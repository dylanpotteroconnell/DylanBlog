<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Free throws: Lebron James 73.4% <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html" class="uri">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html</a>
Shaquille O’Neal: 52.7% <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html" class="uri">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html</a>
(<a href="https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html" class="uri">https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/b2.html</a> would need to observe 85 before we were confident).</p>
<p>Barry Bonds had an almost impossible 6.5 AB/HR.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bats_per_home_run" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bats_per_home_run</a></p>
<p>A typical team would average about 24 AB/HR. <a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/mlb/stat/at-bats-per-home-run" class="uri">https://www.teamrankings.com/mlb/stat/at-bats-per-home-run</a>
(We would need to observe 109 at bats. It seems most players can expect about <a href="https://fantasy.fangraphs.com/buying-generic-plate-appearances-by-lineup-spot/">4.5 at bats per game</a>, so we might need 24 games of watching these mystery players to be actually reasonably confident we are watching the most absurd statistical anomaly season ever, rather than just a typical modern hitter.
