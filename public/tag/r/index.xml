&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll describe my introductory exploration of Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, using Steve Scott’s &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf&#34;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt;, applied to the total weekly box office gross (i.e. ticket sales) of American movie theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intended to help me think through and explain the concepts and methods, and is not intended as a case study with a clear goal. In fact, I’ll analyze the ways in which these models do not necessarily fit the data setting, which should highlight potential pitfalls for projects where a powerfully predictive end result is key. My aim is simply to talk through the concepts, start to flesh out my own understanding of a topic I know almost nothing about.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, this is geared at those who are already comfortable with statistics and R. The explanations are for my own benefit, but others might find the explanation of the BSTS models helpful (as well as my assorted musings on theg oals of interest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this project is not a tidy and powerfully predictive model for weekly box office gross, the point is the process where we think through the limits of our inference. In fact, I purposefully do not set out a specific goal (be it long term forecasting, or interpreting the industry trends), because I want to consider how these flexible models can provide insight for many different purposes, and how that flexibility can also present subtle difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we will show how a model with a reasonable short term forecast can provide a disastrously useless long term forecast, and that these are two very distinct challenges. This is just the tip of the iceberg for a much broader idea, but the distinction is not discussed enough. We will see that time series models must be built with their ultimate goal in mind, and different models may serve different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- As we&#39;ll see, the class of models are likely not a particularly apt fit to the domain in question. This doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no inferential value in the final result, but it does mean we have to be very conservative about what inferences we draw. BSTS models are exactly the sort of flexible structure that can provide alluringly useful accurate fits in certain contexts, only for the model to totally fall apart when stretched too far. This result is mostly due to my choice of data set (which I picked without careful consideration for its final use), but I think it&#39;s an illustrative example, because it can feel very natural to apply these models in ways which may not be theoretically sound (and they still might provide some insight in those cases, if used with appropriate caution). Above all, this is simply an opportunity for me to dip my toes into an unfamiliar topic, and I&#39;m using this post as an excuse to articulate my own understanding of the topic, and make sure I&#39;m comfortable with the basics. --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response variable is the weekly total of American theater movie ticket sales, in dollars, as tallied by &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/%22&#34;&gt;Box Office Mojo&lt;/a&gt;. We consider all weeks dating from 2019 back to 1993.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box Office Mojo also lists a few added goodies, like “Releases”,^{The total number of distinct movies which grossed money that week.}, the name of the “Top Release”, and whether or not it is a “Long Weekend”. For this initial exploration, we ignore these covariates, and stick to the date and the weekly gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekly.tb &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;weekly_gross.csv&amp;quot;)
select &amp;lt;- dplyr::select
weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% names()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;gross&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;top_release&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;releases&amp;quot;    
## [6] &amp;quot;long_weekend&amp;quot; &amp;quot;dates&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;start_date&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;cleaning-the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekly.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::select(start_date, gross, releases, everything())
weekly.tb %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = start_date, y = gross)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) + 
  ylab(&amp;quot;Gross ($)&amp;quot;) + 
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Weekly (American) Box Office Gross&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
Looking at the time series, we first note that there are enormous week-to-week spikes. As we will discuss in greater detail, this reflects the release of new blockbusters, and it reflects unobserved data (of course, we have some useful approximations, such as the fact that a major blockbuster is often released around Christmas). Intuitively, our lack of access shows that there is probably a great deal of irreducible uncertainty for us in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;inflation-adjustment&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Adjustment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we note that there’s an obvious upward trend in the time series, but that doesn’t tell us much, due to the steady effects of inflation. Of course, we could simply ignore this, and rely on the model to track the effects of inflation. However, this tends to cause problems, because it conflates the trends we might care about, with those that are relatively well understood. Broadly, the interesting temporal trends will be easier to detect if we first control for the &lt;em&gt;uninteresting&lt;/em&gt; trends, like inflation. We cite the &lt;code&gt;blscrapeR&lt;/code&gt; package, and our response variable is instead the weekly gross in terms of adjusted “2019 Dollars”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- but any time series in nominal dollars is bound  but that will be true for almost there&#39;s an obvious upward trend in our time series, just about everything has gotten more expensive in the past 30 years, due to inflation. Our first step is to work with the inflation adjusted dollar weekly gross. If this cleaning step is not taken, and a time series is fit blind to the data, you can waste your time chasing after some temporal trend that simply reflects this natural increase in prices. We cite the priceR package, which can download the relevant CPI data and do the work for us.  --&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(blscrapeR)
inf_adj &amp;lt;- inflation_adjust(2019)
weekly.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% left_join(inf_adj %&amp;gt;%
                                       select(year, 
                                              adj_value) %&amp;gt;%
                                       mutate(year = as.numeric(year)),
                                     by = &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(gross_ia = gross/adj_value) %&amp;gt;%
  select(-adj_value)

weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(`Nominal` = mean(gross),
            `Inflation Adjusted` = mean(gross_ia)) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;, values_to = &amp;quot;Mean Yearly Gross ($)&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Mean Yearly Gross ($)`, 
                col = Type)) + 
  xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Yearly Mean Gross&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Yearly Mean Gross: Nominal vs Inflation Adjusted.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- # library(priceR) --&gt;
&lt;!-- #  --&gt;
&lt;!-- # weekly.tb &lt;- weekly.tb %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!-- #   mutate(gross_ia = adjust_for_inflation(gross,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- #                                          year,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- #                                          country = &#34;US&#34;,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- #                                          to_date = 2019)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the underlying trend is still real, and the surge in box office gross from the 90s through the early 2000s appears quite meaningful. But the natural inclusion of inflation does help reduce some of the impact of the trend, which may influence our modeling.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-scale-of-the-response-variable&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Scale of the Response Variable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will fit our model onto the log of the box office gross (using base 10, rather than the typical &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt;, as this has a more intuitive numerical conversion for these large decimals). Intuitively, box office cannot be negative, so if we are fitting models which assume some sort of normality, this conversion is natural. Of course, we will see that while such a conversion fixes the most glaring violation of the assumptions, that does not automatically mean that the model fits! In fact, in this exploration we will see just how difficult it is to find a tidy model for box office gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekly.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(log_gross_ia = log10(gross_ia),
         log_gross = log10(gross))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we will plan to &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; the model on the regular scale, as we could imagine that “dollars” tend to mean more to any interested party than “log dollars” (a rather made-up measurement). I’m not sure if there is a rigorous choice here, surely it depends on the setting. But we are choosing the log transformation not because it captures the trend we care about, but because it seems to more plausibly fit the &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; we plan to use. In this case, the model should be evaluated based on the target of interest.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Broadly, this provides good practice with how to convert from a model fit on a certain scale, to inferences drawn on another scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bayesian-structural-time-series-model&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bayesian Structural Time Series Model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this introduction, we will cite a Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model. We can take this piece by piece. A “time series” is a sequence of data points which are indexed by time. It’s a particular category of statistics, because it fundamentally violates the core “independent and identically distributed” assumption that underpins much of statistical inference. While that renders many classical statistical procedures infeasible, the temporal relationship amongst the data is the whole point! We want to understand this evolution, which means that we must rely on a model which leverages this index on time. For notation, we write &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_1, \ldots, y_T\)&lt;/span&gt; for the response variables of interest (in this case, the log gross).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bayesian” follows its standard applied definition, as our objective is not a hypothesis test of point estimate with some desirable properties, but rather a posterior distribution on the parameters of interest (the parameters which describe our time series model). These parameters are determined by the “Structural” part of the model, whcih requires a careful definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-structural-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Structural” Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “structural time series” is a model of response data indexed by time, whose temporal relationship is defined by the interplay of two equations. First, we have the &lt;em&gt;transition&lt;/em&gt; equation, which models how a latent (i.e. unobserved state) &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt; evolves over time.
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{t+1} &amp;amp;= T_t \alpha_t + R_t \eta_t, ~~~~~~ \eta_t \sim N(0, Q_t)\label{eqn:bsts_transition}
\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;
Before we explain any of these pieces, it’s best to introduce the second part, the  equation, which models how the observed response &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is generated using the state variable, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align}
y_{t} &amp;amp;= Z_t^T \alpha_t + \epsilon_t, ~~~~~~ \epsilon_t \sim N(0, H_t).\label{eqn:bsts_observation}
\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;
Thus, while a classic time series might model the relationship between &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_{t+1}\)&lt;/span&gt; directly, a &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; time series model instead links them through some latent, unobserved state, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt;, which evolves underneath unseen, and influences the observed &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sensible setup because often time series are understood to be random observations of some underlying “state” in our system, which we cannot observe directly. If you conduct monthly opinion polling with a relatively small sample, this can readily be understood as a structural time series, because the target of interest is the underlying latent state (the public’s opinion on a particular issue), while the observations are noisy datum which are heavily influenced by that latent state. Thus, it makes sense for us to model our understanding of the latent state itself, rather than the latest noisy observation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this understanding, the rest of the terms fall into place. &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Z_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt; vector, whose coefficients define the relationship between the latent state and the response (subject to the noise, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_t\)&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(T_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;state transition matrix&lt;/em&gt;, which determines the evolution of the latent state, along with the noise &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt; (with state-diffusion matrix &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Q_t\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most general statement, and it covers a vast array of potential models. In particular, the allure of this structure is that these models are naturally &lt;em&gt;additive&lt;/em&gt;, which makes for easy modular construction. In this brief introduction, I won’t go into much detail about its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we proceed to fitting the data itself, a brief note about the normal errors, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_t\)&lt;/span&gt;. The particular computational appeal of this model is that the additive composition of these normal errors allows the posterior distributions to be normal themselves. This structure allows for the use of the Kalman filter introduction quite clear.] to compute the estimate the distributions of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of the Kalman filter (and smoother) is a bit tricky to explain, so it is ommitted here,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but the important punchline is that this model requires normally distributed errors. There is no particular reason to assume that the errors of weekly box office gross should be normally distributed! We will investigate this further, but in the use of these models, often far too little attention is paid to the model specification (as we will see that we obtain some sensible results, even with a poorly fitting model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;computation&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf&#34;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; is developed by Steve Scott, and provides a host of tools to make ABDDF. His specific approach, combining the Kalman filter with a spike-and-slab prior, was introduced in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nber.org/chapters/c12995&#34;&gt;neat paper&lt;/a&gt; showing how search trends could be used to “Nowcast”.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The bsts package allows for the quick construction of common BSTS models with minimal effort, and provides a host of tools for their analysis. It’s worth noting that Tensorflow has its own package for Bayesian structural time series modeling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/sts&#34;&gt;tfp.sts&lt;/a&gt;), which provides an alternative, for those comfortable with Tensorflow, and the additional features it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;our-theoretical-model&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our Theoretical Model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we could simply fit the time series itself, and look at the results. First, we consider the insights of Tassone &amp;amp; Rohani on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/04/our-quest-for-robust-time-series.html&#34;&gt;Google Unofficial Data Science Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Their excellent post covers a range of topics regarding the application of time series, with a particular focus on robust systems that can be applied robustly at scale (that is, applied in a wide range of unknown situations, and provide reaonable outcomes). That is, at scale, you often do not have the luxury of considering the underlying mechanism of the time series. They cite the power of aggregating a wide range of models, whose fit onto individual components provides the desired robustness to unknown inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their goal is purely predictive, rather than inferential (i.e. “What happens?” not “Why it happens?”).&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In our case, we have the luxury of thinking about the data setting, and considering what types of models make any sense. Thus, we begin with a discussion of the limits of our inference, before considering several of the tools available, and planning which models we can fit. As we will see, our goals are not necessarily a good fit for a BSTS model! The goal of this post is simply to introduce myself to these tools, and part of that is recognizing these limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-limits-of-prediction-and-inference&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Limits of Prediction and Inference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to start with the &lt;em&gt;limits&lt;/em&gt; of the domain. If the goal of our time series was to model the Cosmic Microwave Background noise over time, we can stop right away, because it consists of entirely irreducible uncertainty, and our model has nothing to offer. More commonly, we might not have a &lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; theory of the data, but we have a rough idea of connections which might exist, and we wish to fit some models and see which have predictive and inferential merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clear limits to our capabilities given this dataset. Intuitively, the most important factor in determining the weekly box office gross has nothing to do with the general “state of the movie business”, and it has everything to do with &lt;em&gt;what movie was just released&lt;/em&gt;. This presents a significant impediment to our modeling. We have an intuitive grasp of the theory, but it’s not something that can easily be modeled! Of course, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; model the ticket sales of the biggest new release, but that’s a separate challenge, and has little to do with this time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- In an ideal world, every modeling challenge would aim to perfectly capture the theory of the setting. In practice, we often work in situations like these. This post aims to analyze the *limits* of such an appraoch. How &#34;far&#34; can a BSTS model get us, even when we know that it is not a perfect fit for the setting? Reading about people practicing these models online, it&#39;s common to find settings with such a theoretical mismatch. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, assuming that we don’t have prescience about the release of “Avengers: Endgame”, what are some reasonable theoretical assumptions we can make? Well, first, we might expect the continuity of which movies are in theaters to provide us with a natural form of autocorrelation. The rate of decline in a movie’s second week at the same theater is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_weekend_in_box_office_performance&#34;&gt;widely studied&lt;/a&gt; phenomenom, and it is consistently between 40 and 60 percent. Now, there are dozens of movies contributing to the total weekly gross, so the relationship won’t be nearly so tidy, but this still provides a clear form of autocorrelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, we might intuitively expect there to be “trends” in the movie industry. The end of the 70s saw the rise of the blockbuster, the grosses of the biggest hits has steadily risen,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref9&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the relative popularity of different genres is always in flux. We might attempt to capture this with some sort of local slope for the latent state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we might expect there to be seasonal &lt;em&gt;weekly&lt;/em&gt; effects. Box office grosses are commonly compared to the same weeks in previous years, because of the assumption of consistent patterns. It is understood that over Christmas, many people go to the movies, whereas the theaters are comparatively dry throughout February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we could find a more nuanced understanding of the autocorrelation. By its nature, a BSTS model introduces autocorrelation, because response data which are close in time are linked by the underlying latent state. Given that we expect there to be some degree of continuity movie theaters from week to week (as movies phase in and out slowly, in addition to the aforementioned trends), this is fitting, but the point is that it is possible to be much more precise with how the autocorrelation is modeled (for instance, perhaps a sharp increase in ticket sales in one week implies a sharp drop the next, due to a single huge movie release). The point of this post is for my own education, not to actually produce the most accurate model, so I proceed with a more straightforward BSTS model here, and I will critique it if it appears to be a poor fit.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref10&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;initial-models&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Initial Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin by fitting a few starter models, which we can use to demonstrate the tools to analyze these models. While we will follow our insight above, we will see that without more care, there is little reason to think that these models are a precise fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can start with a local linear trend, which provides a common and flexible state space model (this is a useful starting point because of its generality, but that does not guarantee that it reflects the situation). In short, a local linear trend assumes that both the mean, the trend (i.e. the slope) of the latent state evolution are drawn from a random walk. That is, if &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt; is the mean of the latent state.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref11&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\mu_{t+1} = \mu_t + \delta_t + \epsilon_{\mu, t},
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_{\mu,t} \sim N(0, \sigma_\mu^2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is our random walk. Then, the evolution of the slope is similarly given by
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\delta_{t+1} = \delta_t + \epsilon_{\delta, t},
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_{\delta,t} \sim N(0, \sigma_\mu^2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is another random walk. How these terms relate to our overall transition and observation equations will be clear once they are combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we consider the “seasonal” model, that is, any fixed time cycle with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; possible states in the cycle). For these &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; seasons, we create an &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S-1\)&lt;/span&gt; dimension state vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_t\)&lt;/span&gt; (as we constrain the coefficients to sum to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;) and in essence our model performs regression using these coefficients and dummy variables corresponding to the current season for the given time &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then, the first element of the season state vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_t\)&lt;/span&gt; evolves as
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\gamma_{t+1, 1} = -1*\sum_{s=2}^S \gamma_{t, s} + \epsilon_(\gamma),
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_(\gamma) \sim N(0, \sigma_\gamma^2)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#34;If predictor variables are present, the regression coefficients are fixed (as opposed to time varying, --&gt;
&lt;!-- though time varying coefficients might be added as state component). The predictors and response --&gt;
&lt;!-- in the formula are contemporaneous, so if you want lags and differences you need to put them in --&gt;
&lt;!-- the predictor matrix yourself.&#34; -bsts Docs --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these two commponents, we can fit our twin initial models. Our “season” model consists of just the seasonal component, with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S=52\)&lt;/span&gt; allowing a regression on every single unique week of the year, and the “LLT” model adding to that a local linear trend. When just using the seasonal model, we need to add to it a static intercept term, so that the mean isn’t wildly off. While the purpose of this is more educational than anything else, it’s useful to be clear on what this could show. Comparing these models essentially takes for granted the folk wisdom that the precise week of the year influences the “state” of ticket sales. Then, comparing these models can help understand if there is some basis for tracing local trends in the movie business, or if that is just overfitting to noise.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref12&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; package makes fitting these models extremely easy. The “state specification” is a list of state components. We construct a seasonal state space, add a static intercept, and fit the model. This post is meant as a reminder of the underlying theory, so it won’t go into the technical details of what the model produces (which are covered in the documentation), but broadly the model object which results from bsts() contains the relevant parameters and samples from the posterior distribution which we want (with the one technical caveat that it returns all iterations of its posterior sampler, so if you want to access those samples yourself, you need to remove the burn-in segment manually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.season &amp;lt;- AddSeasonal(list(), 
                         weekly.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                         nseasons = 52)
ss.season.intercept &amp;lt;- AddStaticIntercept(ss.season,
                                          weekly.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.season &amp;lt;- bsts(weekly.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                     state.specification = ss.season.intercept,
                     niter = 500, 
                     ping = 0, 
                     seed = 21)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the models are modular, to create our local linear trend state specification, we simply add the local linear trend to our already specified seasonal component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.llt &amp;lt;- AddLocalLinearTrend(ss.season,
                              weekly.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.llt &amp;lt;- bsts(weekly.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                  state.specification = ss.llt,
                  niter = 500, 
                  ping = 0, 
                  seed = 21)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Comparing the Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should first be said that models cannot be analyzed in isolation. In practice, we should begin by specifying our goals, and the costs associated with poor results. Here, we sketch out some relevant tools to analyze these forecasts, recognizing that their actual application is dependent on the specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-bsts-package-tools&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; Package Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; package comes preloaded with useful functions for analysis of the results. We start with &lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModels()&lt;/code&gt;, which charts the cumulative absolute error of our one-step predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModels(list(Seasonal = model.season, 
                       LLT = model.llt))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
With a single line of code, we can see how the additional flexibility of the local linear trend does indeed make our predictions more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re unfamiliar with BSTS models, it’s not immediately clear what exactly this is measuring, and it’s important to be very precise. “Cumulative absolute error” is clear enough, but what errors is it referring to? These are the “one-step-ahead” prediction errors, where the data points are drawn from the posterior computed by the Kalman filter. Unfortunately, we can’t be too rigorous about this description without going into the theoretical details of the filter, but the gist is that the Kalman filter computes the posterior distribution for the next response data point, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p(y_t | y_{1:t-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;, recursively through the posterior on the latent state posterior, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p(\alpha_t | y_{1:t-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref13&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our model object contains posterior draws (in our case, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(500\)&lt;/span&gt; of them) for each posterior distribution &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p(y_t | y_{1:t-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;. The “errors” above are the difference between these posterior samples, and the actual observed data point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses a problem for applying this function directly to our setting. The mean absolute prediction errors are computed on the response data, which are logarithms, whereas we are most likely interested in errors on the regular scale. The fix is simply to grab the relevant parts of the &lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModels()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdrr.io/cran/bsts/src/R/compare.bsts.models.R&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;, and do a bit of surgery until it suits our purpose. We take the one-step errors directly from the model object, and remove the burn-in. Then, we convert from posterior errors in the log scale, to posterior errors on the regular scale. If such a log-scale posterior error is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;, our response (in regular scale, not log) as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;, and our predicted value as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{e} = \log_{10} \hat{y} - \log_{10}y\)&lt;/span&gt;. Thus, the errors we want are given by
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\hat{e} &amp;amp;= \log_{10} \hat{y} - \log_{10}y\\
\hat{y} - y &amp;amp;= 10^{\hat{e}}y -y = (10^{\hat{e}}-1)y.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, this transformation doesn’t radically change the picture, it’s still measuring the same errors. But the units of absolute error are now interpretable, the difference between the two is more clear, and there could be cases where computing the errors based on the logs would lead to unintuitive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as we keep repeating, one should think carefully about the goals of the analysis. The cumulative error is an intuitive metric, but it’s not particularly Bayesian (as it is computed using a simple point estimate on the posterior). If the ultimate output of the model is a sequence of these point estimates, then it is a sensible place to start. If the goal is to construct a full posterior probability that captures the theoretical situation, it won’t be very meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; package offers a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdrr.io/cran/bsts/man/plot.bsts.html&#34;&gt;variety of other plotting tools&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;code&gt;PlotBstsComponents()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PlotBstsForecastDistribution()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PlotSeasonalEffect()&lt;/code&gt;, and more), but they didn’t appear very informative when applied directly out of the box to this data set. Which isn’t surprising, it’s hard to write general purpose plotting functions. In almost all cases, it’s better to construct your own, to tackle the task at hand.

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we can see that the seasonal model is more conservative, and sticks with the broadly known weekly trends. It predicts spikes at major holidays, but otherwise misses on the unexpected micro trends. The LLT model &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make an attempt to predict these large spikes. It’s a very difficult task given the data, so we only see a moderate improvement in the MAPE. They represent two different philosophies, and the choice might depend on the specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these are simply fitting point estimates, the means of the one-step posterior predictive distributions. In the tutorials I saw online, this was the the typical example used (with posterior distributions cited for the coefficients themselves), but we do have a full distribution to work with. We consider the rate of coverage for the 95% credible intervals for both distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CheckOneStepCalibration(tb.season)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that neither one-step calibration is what we would hope, with only about 75% and 72%, respectively, for the seasonal and LLN model predictions capturing the observed data within their credible interval. We also see that the slight advantage in MAPE for the more flexible model evaporates under this perspective, which makes sense: the more aggressive model sometimes tries to “predict” a release that doesn’t occur. This helps slightly with its MAPE, but means it is more likely to whiff entirely in the credible interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These credible intervals are not well calibrated, and it is not particularly surprising. We know there is a large amount of irreducible uncertainty in the system that our model does not capture. Ultimately, for a properly calibratd model, we would need to restructure it from these composition of normal models, to something that represents the theory of the system itself. It’s certainly notable that the seasonal effect alone seems to capture most of the variability, and that the addition of a local trend doesn’t appear to be significantly superior (depending on our goals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there any use to these models at all? We might consider the argument by a skeptic, who thinks that the additional assumptions we pose are misguided, and the simplest of models is just as apt. Such a model would consist solely of a static intercept (note, it is not simply a flat model, it still has our composition of normal components, just without a trend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we follow the same basic evaluative steps as above, we can see that the static intercept model has about 25% MAPE (compared to 16% before), and about 10 percentage point drop in coverage by the credible interval. Clearly, the flexibility afforded by our seasonal modeling adds to the predictive power. However, as we’d expect, the models shown above are quite flawed, and the fact that they are not too many miles ahead of the static model is cause for further scrutiny of our theoretical setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- I&#39;m still a little uncertain on this part, I actually thought that the mean one-step posterior predictive value of a static model might be fixed, should investigate further. --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coefficients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, predictive power is not the only allure of constructing such a Bayesian model. While not the focus of this exploration, we can also examine the resulting model coefficients. In this case, we take a peak at the seasonal coefficients that result from the pure seasonal model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;burn &amp;lt;- SuggestBurn(.1, model.season)
components &amp;lt;- cbind.data.frame(

  weekly.tb$start_date)  
names(components) &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Seasonality&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at box plots for each of the 52 weeks, showing their spread. We also consider the visual trend of the week coefficients over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;components %&amp;gt;% mutate(week_number = row_number() %% 52) %&amp;gt;%

&lt;p&gt;We can observe the typically expected trends. While January is a strong month (due to Oscars hits being in theaters, and the tail end of Christmas), theaters hit a low during the early months of the year, before surging at summer, lagging in the fall, and surging again around Christmas.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref14&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;brief-mention-of-long-term-forecasting&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brief Mention of Long Term Forecasting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this exploration, I have mentioned how I am being purposefully fuzzy about the goals of the model. It is important to emphasize that, because in any real application, these goals would have to be foregrounded in the construction of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; model (whereas the point of this post is to just explore the tools). One example of this is in a critical distinction between types of prediction: forecasting in the long run, and forecasting the next step (or “nowcasting”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Olavson’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2019/12/humans-in-loop-forecasting-integrating.html&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the objective automation of forecasting helps clarify this distinction. He calls the long run objective “strategic forecasting, which has low update frequency, uncertainty which is difficult to quantify, and whose outputs are used in high stakes decision making (with significant human interpretation). By comparison,”tactical forecasting&amp;quot; is a mostly automated process, making countless micro predictions at scale, whose automation can be guided by frequent backtesting (and related strategies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, it seems that Bayesian Structural Time Series models should be perfectly serviceable at either goal. The original paper by Scott &amp;amp; Varian focuses on the short term nowcasting, but the interpretability of the Bayesian framework makes longer term forecasts a reasonable application. However, the models may be built quite differently when we keep these goals in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicitly, our work this far has been geared towards tactical forecasting, using the model to construct point estimates for each subsequent time step, relying on a relatively flexible fit to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our full model computed earlier uses the Kalman smoother and is fit over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the data. Thus, to get a sense of how this might work for forecasting, we need to turn to a training and test set structure. We pick the cut-off arbitrarily at the end of 2016 (we would hope that the model is relatively agnostic about this choice, but we will see that in this case, it is not). In a more serious application, it would likely make sense to compute models for a sequence of forecast cut-offs, but this choice is just for a quick demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cutoff &amp;lt;- 2016
# Divide into &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; set (for forecasting)
train.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(year &amp;lt;= cutoff)
test.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(start_date &amp;gt; cutoff)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again compute the same two models as before. The 52 week seasonal model, with a static intercept (just on the training data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.season.train &amp;lt;- AddSeasonal(list(), 
                               train.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                               nseasons = 52)
ss.season.intercept.train &amp;lt;- AddStaticIntercept(ss.season.train,
                                                train.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.season.train &amp;lt;- bsts(train.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                           state.specification = ss.season.intercept.train,
                           niter = 500, 
                           ping = 0, 
                           seed = 21)

p.season &amp;lt;- predict.bsts(model.season.train, 
                         horizon = weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow() - 
                           train.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the model where we add a local linear trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.llt.train &amp;lt;- AddLocalLinearTrend(ss.season.train,
                                    train.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.llt.train &amp;lt;- bsts(train.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                        state.specification = ss.llt.train,
                        niter = 500, 
                        ping = 0, 
                        seed = 21)
p.llt &amp;lt;- predict.bsts(model.llt.train, 
                      horizon = weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow() - 
                        train.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now use the &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; built in feature for plotting these forecasts, showing the fitted values and credible intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(p.season, plot.original = 52*2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real punchline here is that both models make moderately similar projections for the next few years. However, the plots aren’t too revealing yet, and we want to compare them to the observed values.
We can rework our earlier functions to now compute MAPE for both fitted and predicted. Now, in addition to the credible interval (for both the one-step predictions, and the future forecasts), we zoom in on the time period which is forecast (based on our training data, up until the end of 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that both seem to offer reasonably useful forecasts, with calibration (over the entire period, combining both one-step and forecasts)\footnote[Perhaps these should be separated, I haven’t found resources discussing the best way to evaluate these models.] in a similar range as before, and the forecast range seemingly capturing much of the observed trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the particular difference between the two models becomes clear in the distant forecast. The seasonal model is more consistent, with fairly static uncertainty. With the addition of the local linear trend, we become more confident in the short run, but have much less confidence once we project several years out. This is because the local linear trend is extremely flexible, which becomes particularly apparent when considering outcomes several years away. Whether the state of the movie business is sufficiently static for this to be a poor assumption will depend on who you ask.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref15&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;not-far-from-madness&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Far From Madness?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our starter models continue to perform moderately well (if unexceptionally), it is illustrative to consider how easy this modeling can go badly wrong. It only takes a few wrong choices for a model to go from simply incomplete, to totally nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, what happens if we remove our seasonal correction, and left the local linear trend in to capture this seasonal variation? As the movie industry heats up in the summer months, perhaps the local linear trend is sufficient to capture that growth. We certainly would expect our accuracy to decrease, we’ve established that the week of the year is a critical predictor of the weekly gross. However, what we’ll see below is that the removal of the seasonal adjustment makes the model &lt;em&gt;completely useless&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to longer term forecasting, not simply “inaccurate”.&lt;/p&gt;

We can see that the results are completely nonsensical. It is a little more clear when using the built in prediction plots (although the dates are removed, I didn’t have time to add those back in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(p.base, plot.original = 52*2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recall that the original series is on the &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; scale, which helps clarify the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intuitive explanation is straightforward enough. Without the seasonal adjustment, the local linear trend has learned from the data that there is great variability. The slope is constantly changing direction, multiple times per year, so it assigned a large variance in its movements. Without observing any new data, this uncertainty compounds, as the model thinks that the slope could be rapidly growing, or rapidly falling. And worse, this all happens on that log scale. So we quickly see the range of uncertainty about the state state double and triple in log units, which leads to absurd credible intervals for the future predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting about this is that our short run predictions are not so impossible. We can see in the comparison below that the model without seasonality is clearly inferior, but it simply looks like simply a moderate step down. It’s only once we take stab at long term forecasting that we see that the use of a local linear trend without a seasonal adjustment fully breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModelsLog(list(`LLT + Seasonal` = model.llt.train,
                          `LLT Without Seasonal` = model.base))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reiterates the aforementioned discussion in Thomas Olavson’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2019/12/humans-in-loop-forecasting-integrating.html&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, distinguishing tactical and strategic forecasting. He discusses the great theoretical and practical differences between the two challenges. This frivolous example is simply a reminder of how easy theoretical models can break, when we are careless with the data. Long term forecasting requires more theoretical care, as we cannot rely on automatic processes fitting relevant patterns in the data and avoiding disaster. Poor theoretical assumptions will lead to useless forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Exploring the Autocorrelation --&gt;
&lt;!-- One challenge is that these effects are all closely related. The introduction of regular seasonal effects can mask effects of auto correlation. To be honest, I don&#39;t know the best way to solve this. Eventually, the model should be well equipped to sort them out, but in the exploration stage, it&#39;s not so clear. For now, I will simply resort to a crude method at de-seasoning the model, by normalizing the grosses by the mean gross for each of the 52 weeks. This should help uncover autocorrelative effects. However, the model itself will be fit on data without this adjustment, because it will apply a more delicate (and Bayesian) treatment to these seasonal terms. I&#39;m curious what the best pratice here would be.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- weekly.tb &lt;- weekly.tb %&gt;%  --&gt;
&lt;!--   group_by(week) %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--   mutate(week_mean_ia = mean(gross_ia)) %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--   ungroup() %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--   mutate(gross_ia_week_adj = gross_ia - week_mean_ia + mean(gross_ia)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- We use the Acf function from the &#34;forecast&#34; package, which computes the correlation of the data for each &#34;lag&#34; (the number of steps back). Thus, we can see here that there is a strong positive correlation between the inflation adjusted weekly gross and the previous week, but once you get to around 10 weeks or so, the correlation becomes negative (if slight).  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- library(forecast) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Acf(weekly.tb$gross_ia) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- However, this is applied to our original data, and the presumed seasonal effects might be causing potential problems. When we instead compute an ACF plot for the week-normalized gross, we see instead that the positive autocorrelation is *consistent*. This makes a good deal of sense. The 10 to 15 weeks we were looking at above is a long enough period of time, that you essentially switch &#34;movie seasons&#34;. Thus, intuitively it fits that there might be some negative correlation, as the low point of the movie year (around February and March), are roughly 10-20 weeks offset from some of the busiest movie times (Christmas, and the summer, in the two directions). --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- Acf(weekly.tb$gross_ia_week_adj) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- This local trend is typical of most time series models, but we might want to consider a slightly more advanced version.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Now, we apply [differencing](https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html)  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using time series for forecasting is an exceptionally tricky endeavor, and this post is just a brief introduction as I dip my toe into the field. Looking at how time series are used publicly online can often give you the sense that it’s a matter of plugging the data into a flexible model, fitting the curve, and hoping for the best. However, it’s important to be precise about the inferential goals of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punch line from this analysis might simply be “don’t cite a Bayesian time series when the specified joint probability model doesn’t naturally reflect our best understanding of the underlying process”. And that might be fair, outside of an introductory context I would be hesitant to say much of anything about such a tenuous approaach to modeling (I’d probably tell my boss just to take a look at the movies that are coming out, and see if he recognizes the names, before I try and use past data to predict the weekly box office gross!). But these models are often applied in imperfect ways, and I’ve found it illustrative to work carefully through one such example, and try and understand the mechanics of the model under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the distinction between long run and short term forecasting is critical. They are markedly different challenges, which call for different tools and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Eric Tassone &amp; Farzan Rohani provide an insightful [blog post](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/04/our-quest-for-robust-time-series.html) examining the way that time series forecasting can and should cite ensemble averaging. --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, I may work professionally on projects along these lines, but I made sure to finish writing this before I saw this in a professional setting, as at that point I might have to think about what I could share.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e. my lifetime.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is an incredibly obvious correction, and I left it until now mostly to make a point about an easy but damaging mistake, it’s also not quite so apparent that it is a perfect and tidy fix. Between the 90s and today, it likely is sufficient, but there are other notable societal changes that can make comparing ticket sales difficult.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we evaluate this transformation, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error becomes nonsensical, where being off by a factor of two leads to only a small penalty.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not classical time series don’t have good ways of handling this problem too! While it would indeed be foolish to consider the prior observation, the sole piece of information denoting the current state, time series models have a rich array of tools to handle these complex forms of autocorrelation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://eml.berkeley.edu/~rothenbe/Fall2007/kalman.pdf&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; quite helpful.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting an unobserved response occurring in the given moment&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn8&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I use “Predictive” to refer to the task of forecasting the future response (including in the very next step), and “Inferential” to refer to understanding trends in the data (e.g. the posterior distribution of the parameters in a sensible Bayesian model should provide useful inference.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn9&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we will see in a later section, this deserves more careful consideration.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn10&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I return to this dataset, my next approach will focus on explicitly modeling the structure of the autocorrelation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn11&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of this is grabbed right from the bsts manual, whose documentation is very helpful.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn12&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if neither model captures the situation, this inference can be complicated, but it’s still useful to explore the area.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn13&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_{1:t} := (y_1, \ldots, y_t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, matching the typical Kalman filter notation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn14&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am still not entirely confident about the interpretation of these plots, will return soon to clear this up.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn15&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, it has likely been too consistent for this to be sensible, but given that this is being written as the movie industry is shut down during COVID-19, greater tail uncertainty doesn’t seem unreasonable.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In progress, this will be a post which aims to explain in layman’s terms the way that the addition of noise can help gradient descent escape spurious optima (and how this has an intuitive interpretation in our own lives)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Outline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note, this was openly inspired by the writings of Tim Harford. I ound his descriptiption of the London Tube Strike and its implications while struggling through the study of Langevin diffusions, and I had been meaning to try and show some visualizations of noisy optimization for a while. He’s a wonderful popular economics communicator, and a lot of fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, try and think of any and all images you can include! minimize text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-perfect-scrambled-eggs&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Perfect Scrambled Eggs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(or “our optimized lives”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[rw]My morning routine is perfectly optimized, a blend of art and science. I’ve settled on an order in which to take the ingredients for scrambled eggs, the exact selection of dishes to use to minimize washing, and the fact that my silver bowl has sides just low enough that beaten egg could escape, and that raw eggs go in the red bowl. I didn’t set out to figure this out, I just made scrambled eggs every morning for years, and over time saw tiny choices that make it go a little smoother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;disruption-and-the-london-subway-strike&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Disruption, and the London Subway Strike&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 4th, 2014, the workers of the London Tube (their underground subway), went on strike, forcing a number of station closures throughout the city. For three days, a subset of commuters found their usual routes to work blocked, and were forced to find alternatives. After the strike, the stations reopened, and life went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three economists saw the opportunity for a natural experiment: only certain commuters were disrupted by the closure, and data tracking individual travel ID cards could be used to compare their movements to those who were unaffected. And surprisingly, life &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; quite go back to normal after the ending of the strike. The ID card data showed that some of the impacted group stuck with their newly discovered routes, and their commuting time decreased as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They even claim that the strike was a net increase in commute time.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mathematical-framework&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Mathematical Framework&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to show how this concept can be naturally articulated in a mathematical framework.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We are describing the challenge of optimization. Here’s a sample definition, from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/mathematical-optimization&#34;&gt;DeepAI website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematical optimization is the process of maximizing or minimizing an objective function by finding the best available values across a set of inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For London commuters, their “objective function” might be the duration of the commute,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the “available values across a set of inputs” might be the route they take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want to find the highest peak in a mountain range (an example we’ll discuss in detail in the next section), the input might be the choice of latitude and longitude, and the objective the elevation at that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When baking chocolate chip cookies, the possible inputs might be the amount of each ingredient, and the order in which they are combined, and the objective function might be the tastiness of the resulting cookie. This isn’t quite a joke, Google once ran a &lt;a href=&#34;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46507.pdf&#34;&gt;cookie optimization experiment&lt;/a&gt; along these lines.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization is vitally important in applied mathematics and statistics, but it can be quite hard. The vast increase in computational power has broadened our horizons for what optimization challenges are possible, but many useful problems remain out of our reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, in optimization, we assume that we can check the value of the objective function at some chosen input. We can try a certain route on the subway and time the duration, we can bake a batch of cookies and eat them, and we will imagine that we have some computer which takes in latitude and longitude coordinates and spits out the altitude (this is called a “query” to the objective function, or perhaps “oracle”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our naive optimization strategy might be to just try a bunch of points. Maybe we can define a grid of latitude and longitude coordinates, check the elevation of each one, and pick the highest. But this naive approach only works when the potential choices of input are sufficiently narrow. In particular, we look at the “dimension” of the input space. Latitude and longitude represent a mere 2-dimensions. The number of points within an exhaustive “grid” of inputs grows exponentially with the dimension of the input. Cookies are comprised by some dozen ingredients. The famous Jacques Torres &lt;a href=&#34;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015819-chocolate-chip-cookies&#34;&gt;cookie recipe&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(12\)&lt;/span&gt; ingredients. If we wanted to try all combinations of a mere five levels of each ingredient, that would be over two hundred thousand possibilities, which is a bit much for even the hungriest baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly confronting optimization challenges in our own life, and we rarely take this naive approach. Instead, we tend to look for small &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; optimizations, whose benefits we can easily identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- * Finding the best route on the subway is something we optimize. While often algorithmic services can do the work for us, in other cases (or the past), we have to figure it out ourselves, and we somehow pick our starting point. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * For an example, let&#39;s imagine we want to find the highest point in a mountain range. We can check an individual point, and see how high it is. How do we find the highest point? The analogy would be something like, instead of latitude and longitude in a mountain range, in our morning routine it would be that &#34;series of choices for how we get to work&#34;.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Now, imagine instead of querying a computer for the height, you yourself were actually in that mountain range. What would you do? Well, you&#39;d look for the peak, but what if you were in a forest? You&#39;d go up. Specifically, you would look at the area around you for *local* guidance. --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;local-optimizations&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Local Optimizations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we bite into a warm cookie, and the text the texture is just right, but there’s not enough chocolate.(more flowery language here?) We wouldn’t just throw up our hands and start from scratch… we’d add more chocolate! It’s hard to look at a cookie recipe, and imagine what the result will taste like. But we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; taste a recipe, and imagine what a small tweak would taste like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “locality” in optimization refers to “closeness” in the input space. In latitude and longitude, this would be literal distance, while the definitions are a bit less cookie in the space of cookie ingredients and subway commutes. Broadly, we are pretty good at understanding. If we increase the amount of chocolate, we now they’ll taste a bit more chocolate-y than they do now. If we increase the amounts of chocolate, butter, baking soda, reduce the amount of flour, and tweak the balance between brown and cane sugar, are we confident we know what the result will taste like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the London Tube experiment, the researchers place some of the blame on the “stylized nature” of the Tube map displayed to commuters. Its spatial distortions make it difficult to spot major inefficiencies in their route, without some external push. By comparison, we can usually estimate the impact of these “local” changes by ourselves. If we get off one stop earlier, maybe our walk to work increases by a minute but we avoid the wait at a crowded station. These slight changes are a bit like increasing just a single ingredient in a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;london_tube_map&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, this describes my relationship with my own food. fijad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my own life, I find this with food all the time. I have a set rotation of dishes I love, that fit my criteria (hassle-free ingredients, saves well for leftoers, etc). I’m happy to make small chaanes to what I eat. I recently realized how well a lone, unadorned sweet potato went with some of my staples. That’s a one step addition, and I can evaluate its impact as I walk the aisles of the store. Sure enough, it quickly became a staple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, I’m sure there are many full dishes out there that would be just as good as my current rotation. But to find a new dish is a risk. There’s no way for me to see all the the links in the chain. Will the ingredients be easy to find? Will I find the cooking burdensome? What will the end result taste like? Are my cooking supplies well suited to the task?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- * We provide some new rules of the game. We know not only the value at these points, we know the shape/slope/etc of the area around it. This is a reasonable relaxation, because we can estimate this shape by querying our computer for the values of the areas near our point (are we going up or down). The rule is that we can&#39;t look far away to see where the peak is (perhaps we&#39;re stuck in the Appalachian forests, and not the sheer granite of the Sierra Nevada).  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * This isn&#39;t arbitrary, it&#39;s a natural understanding of how we actually operate. We are inherently *local* optimizers. We can easily assess the impact of small changes, not not large ones. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * On a morning commute, we can estimate whether taking a turn a few blocks early to avoid a stoplight saves us time. It&#39;s much harder to figure out in advance whether taking the bus or train is easy. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Now, I&#39;d wager that generally, we&#39;re rather good at making small (later, we will call these &#34;local&#34;, due to their geometric interpretation) adjustments. If I realize that by taking a right a few blocks early, I can avoid the long traffic light, I&#39;ll often do it.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * However, there&#39;s a reason these are small changes. We can estimate their impact from where we are. If we considered an entirely new route to work, taking a whole different train line, we would have no way to know what that&#39;s like. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, we imagined a challenge where we tried to find a peak of a mountain range, using a computer which could tell us the elevation of any chosen input point. Let’s imagine that it also tells us the slope of the incline at that point (“which direction is down”). This better reflects our intuition for local optimization, but it’s also not a large change to the game, because we could always simply query the elevation in a small area around our point, and gauge the slope ourselves. Imagine that we are hiking with an altimeter, and we can look around us and see the shape of the nearby slope. However, we can’t just look around and find a faraway peak, because we’re stuck in the forests of the Appalachians rather than the sheer granite ofthe Sierra Nevada. Our intuition tells us the optimization algorithm which is natural: from wherever we are, “go up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;gradient-ascent&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gradient Ascent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intuitive is called “gradient ascent”. Wherever you are, go up. This is quite literal in the case of our mountain range, This section will provide its mathematical definition, but these details aren’t important, and you can skip the notation and go straight to the visualizations if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mathematical-definition&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mathematical Definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- Some explanation of continuous vs discrete space would be nice? --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine we are at some point &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\)&lt;/span&gt; (meaning, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is a point in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;-dimensional space).
(Maybe in English first?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mathematical definition of a crude version of gradient descent.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I’ll describe it in regular words after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt; be our objective function. Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\eta &amp;gt; 0\)&lt;/span&gt; be our scaling constant. We begin at some initial point &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x^{(0)} \in \mathbb{R}^d\)&lt;/span&gt;. For &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k = 0, \ldots,\)&lt;/span&gt;, until convergence, repeat steps 2 through 4(?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute the gradient &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\nabla f(x^{(k)})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set $x^{(k+1)} x^{(k)} + &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\nabla f(x^{(k)})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\nabla f(x^{(k)})\)&lt;/span&gt; is sufficiently small, halt the algorithm, and select &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x^{(k+1)}\)&lt;/span&gt; as our optima. Otherwise, select repeat s&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SGD, and Neural Nets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have seen randomization introduced quite literally, by a random movement. But randomization is often introduced less explicitly into popular algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural networks are the much heralded staple of the rise of machine learning. Their optimization, perhaps consistent of millions or billions of dimensions (we considered a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; dimension for visualization purposes above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft boasted of a neural network with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/zero-deepspeed-new-system-optimizations-enable-training-models-with-over-100-billion-parameters/&#34;&gt;17 billion(!)&lt;/a&gt; parameters, each of which are a dimension to be optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is an enormous amount of potential spurious optima.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we’ve found over the past decade, SGD works “unreasonably well”. It’s explicitly an algorithm for convex optimization, and yet it optimizes these deep networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a variety of complex answers, depending on who you ask, but the staple reason which dates back &lt;a href=&#34;https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/nimes-1991.pdf&#34;&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt; is that its inherent noisiness allows it to escape spurious local optima.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The noisiness comes not fro our explicit introduction, but from the its approximation error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The noise of SGD has little analogy in our own lives, but the way that noise becomes a tool, not a hindrance, in non-convex optimization, is very real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGD is the staple way to optimize neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pointed self help message would say to fine and embrace randomness. But with no such agenda, I can say that’s true, but also incredibly hard to get right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just look at the gif! this is all powerful theory, but hard to chose the right way to introduce noise. in a clean, mathematical scenario, we can study the sorts of noise that are optimal, without any cost. when it comes to our own personal life, we experience this noise as disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous computer scientist Alan Perlis said “Optimization hinders evolution”, and it’s true. This is the fundamental “explore vs exploit” trade-off. We could spend our energy searching for better strategies (“explore”), or we could focus on deriving the benefit from the currently known optimal strategy (“exploit”). In almost every application, there is a trade-off, and it’s very hard to get right. I think our status quo bias and inherently “local” perspective means we’ll typically err on the side of spending too little time exploring, but of course it’s hard to know how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the takeaway could be something as simple as welcoming disruption, rather than resisting it. There’s no point in getting mad at a change to your commute, the world won’t notice (cite quote?), but maybe you can use the simple platitude that this is the necessary phase of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrambled eggs are a wonderful way to start my morning. I doubt there’s much more room to optimize the way I enjoy them. But I’d be foolish to think that there weren’t wildly different options that were just as rewarding. [rw]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winning a Debate: Insights from &#34;Intelligence Squared&#34;</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;How does one measure the winner of a debate? If the debate itself is the focus, it’s wholly unsatisfying to just tally up the opinions of the viewers, as that solely reflects the prior beliefs of the audience. “Intelligence Squared” is an excellent podcast which teaches policy through moderated debate. A resolution is proposed (e.g. “Affirmative Action does more harm than good”), and two teams of two experts argue the issue in a structured setting. Many other programs aim for balance with a halfhearted attempt to pay lip service to the opposing side (without truly believing it), so it’s refreshing to hear passionate and informed argument from both sides of the aisle. If one side cites a misleading statistic, their opponents are ready to actually call them out on it, penalizing the lazy rhetorical tactics that plague discourse in an echo chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the program is the debate itself, but some nominal winner must still be declared. This is determined using a simple formula. The audience is polled before and after the debate (For, Against, or Undecided on the issue), and the side which gains the most votes is the winner. To be clear, I do not think that this method of declaring a winner is a particularly important to the show, nor do I think any listeners actually consider the swings of audience opinion to be the final say on the matter. But it’s still interesting to consider whether or not this is a reasonable way to declare a debate winner. And more broadly, what can the results of a debate tell us about the way that people make up their minds on polarizing issues? Much has been written about the politically charged climate of the present, and the ways in which the media we consume is entrenching us in our positions, leading to static and polarized political views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Intelligence Squared doesn’t just measure the change in support for each side before and after the debate, for events since 2012 it also measured the individual shifts between each category (i.e. “Undecided before and For after”, or “For before and Against after”). This provides a small but insightful dataset looking at the ways in which minds can change on a polarizing issue in the course of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-to-win-a-debate&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does it mean to “win” a debate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence Squared declares their nominal winner with a simple metric, measuring whether the For or Against side had the largest absolute percentage point shift in support from the pre debate to the post debate audience poll. Thus, if the For side originally had 40% support and the Against side 35% support before the debate, and after the debate the For side had 45% support and the Against side had 43% support, the 8 percentage point increase of the Against side trumps the 5 percentage point increase of the For side, and the Against side wins the night. We will refer to this method for determining a victory as the ISM (Intelligence Squared Metric).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this approach stems from the fact that &lt;em&gt;there are a variety of ways that opinions could shift between the three camps&lt;/em&gt;. This is related to both its usage of absolute percentage point change (with no reference to the relative switch), as well as the presence of the undecided voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/94742&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; excellent post by &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; on StackExchange. I have the pleasure of knowing &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; in person, and in characteristic fashion he gives a thorough and insightful analysis of the ways in which we can have different shifts in support (among the different groups) for the same absolute result, in ways that make determining the winner quite difficult. We cite a simple example proposed by &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a situation where originally 20% are For, 60% are Against, and 20% are undecided (we will write this as a vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((.2, .6, .2)\)&lt;/span&gt;). After the debate, the vector of support is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((.3, .4, .3)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Under the ISM, this is a clear and decisive win for the For side, as they gained 10 percentage points of support, while the Against side lost 20 percentage points. However, there are a variety of between-group opinion switches that could lead to this result. &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; suggests that we write these between-group switches in a 3x3 transition matrix, where the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(ij\)&lt;/span&gt;th element represents the percent of the original supporters for the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;th camp before the debate are supporters of the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;th camp after the debate (with For as 1, Against as 2, and Undecided as 3). Then, this represents a plausible transition matrix for our final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mathbb{A} = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 0.32 &amp;amp; 0.29 &amp;amp; 0.32 \\
 0.36 &amp;amp; 0.42 &amp;amp; 0.36 \\
 0.32 &amp;amp; 0.29 &amp;amp; 0.32 \\
\end{array}
\right).
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; explains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, 36% of the “Fors” changed to the other side while only 29% of the “Against” changed to the opposite opinion. Moreover, slightly more of the undecideds (36%) vs 32%) came out “against” rather than for. Although their numbers in this audience decreased, we have a situation (reminiscent of Simpson’s Paradox) in which the “Against” faction clearly won the debate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a possible outcome where Intelligence Squared would declare the “For” side a decisive winner, but in terms of percentage shifts, the “Against” side was more persuasive at both convincing Undecideds to join their side, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; convincing those with a prior opinion to change their viewpoint. This clarifies the challenge inherent in determining the winner of a debate. When one side is initially quite unpopular, they have a larger population of possible voters that they can woo, which makes their proportional gains much higher in absolute terms. There’s certainly a plausible argument that absolute shifts in support should be the most important factor in determining a winner, but this does make the situation more complex. And it gets even messier in cases where the sub-group switches don’t necessarily agree. We might see one side sway a much larger proportion of the Undecided voters, while being less successful at convincing those from the other side to switch. This could leave us without a conclusive winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-has-this-worked-in-practice&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How has this worked in practice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results of the Intelligence Squared debates in reality, we see that the majority of results are uncontroversial. and there is little doubt which side was more convincing. In total, we gather the results from 88 debates from the Intelligence Squared &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with the process described &lt;a href=&#34;https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/debateresults2/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the unpolished scraped dataset &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/IntelSquaredProject/blob/master/votingresultsfinal.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first winning metric we consider is the Intelligence Squared Metric (ISM), which measures shift in absolute percentage of support. We next consider the Undisputed Metric (UDM), which uses the proportional switching outlined above, and only assigns a winner when one side &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; convinces a greater proportion of Undecided voters to join their side, as well as a greater proportion of the other side to switch their opinion. In cases when these do not agree, no winner is declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the first question is whether there are cases where the UDM declares a winner which is the reverse of the ISM, like the toy example outlined above by &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an idle concern, and in fact there have been six debates with this conflicting result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising when the absolute percentage changes are so close (such as in “Cutting the Pentagon’s budget…”), but the other debates show some wildly divergent results. We even see an example of &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt;’s hypothesized situation. In the “Trigger Warnings” debate on 06/23/2018, we see the For camp lose support, the Against camp gain support, and yet we see that the For camp was declared the winner by the UDM. The transition matrix for this debate is shown here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{Trigger Warnings Debate: }\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0.67 &amp;amp; 0.44 &amp;amp; 0.39 \\ 
0.26 &amp;amp; 0.56 &amp;amp; 0.33 \\ 
0.07 &amp;amp; 0.00 &amp;amp; 0.28 \\ 
\end{array}
\right).
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The For camp was able to lure 39% of the Undecided voters, compared to only 33% by the Against camp. And the For side was able to convince 44% of the Against camp to change their minds, while the Against camp convinced only 26% of the For camp to swap. And yet the For camp &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; support, while the Against camp gained support. This can easily be explained by the initial disparity in popularity. The For side began with 57% of the vote, so while they convinced a larger proportion of Undecided and Against voters to change their view, they had a minority of the audience who were even available to sway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of the issue, because it feels fundamentally wrong to declare the winner of the debate to be a side that &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; popularity during the course of the night. This cousin of Simpson’s Paradox defies our intuition, where we want relative and absolute changes to point in the same direction. I think there’s an argument for both sides. The issue with using the UDM (with subgroup proportional shifts) is that there’s an inherent expectation that a debate will shift opinions towards the center. If one group starts overwhelmingly popular, and both sides sway the proportional amount of people to their side, then that side will tend to lose share. It doesn’t make much sense that we would expect any evenly matched debate to bring public opinion towards a 50/50 split, but a series of dead even debates (as measured by the UDM) would push the audience towards that equilibrium point. And yet, we think of the goal of debates as being one of persuasion. And so it makes little sense to declare one side the winner because they had a larger possible audience to persuade, even if their marginal rate of persuasion was inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;are-there-obvious-issues-in-the-original-metric&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are there obvious issues in the original metric?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no singular way to measure the efficacy of these metrics, and it ultimately comes down to our subjective intuition about what it means to “win” a debate. However, we can reasonably agree on some criteria that we intuitively find “fair”. Generally, we want a debate to be a plausibly even playing field from the start. An even more intuitive metric would simply be the popularity of each motion after the debate (which we refer to as the Final Popularity Metric [FPM]), but we reject this approach because it so obviously favors the side that is initially popular with the audience. It’s then worth it to consider whether the ISM is biased in ways that clash with our intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious plausible bias is that of the initial popularity of each position. In fact, this is why we do not simply use the FPM , so it is perhaps instructive to consider what such bias looks like. We plot the initial popularity of the For and Against positions below, and use color to denote the final winner by the FPM (i.e. which position was ultimately more popular with the audience). Exactly as we’d expect, there is a heavy bias to the initial starting positions. There are a few instances where a particularly large swing allows for the initially unfavorable position to pull out a win, but generally the winner is determined simply by initial popularity, and the processs of the debate itself is largely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_FPresults.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![OriginalResults]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_FPresults.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider the same plot colored by the standard ISM results, we see a much more promising picture. On first glance, this adjustment does a plausible job of removing the bias from initial popularity. We theorized that the ISM might be punishing to sides that begin with overwhelming popularity, becuase they have so many fewer people that they can convert to their side (and an increase from 90 to 95 percent popularity might only be 5 percentage points, but represents a massive 50% decrease in those who don’t support that side). However, in practice, most positions start at a popularity between 20% and 50%, so those extreme examples just aren’t as concerning. And within that range, the naked eye doesn’t detect any overwhelming patterns of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_winnerorigresults.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![OriginalResults]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_winnerorigresults.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plausible trend that might stand out lies in the bottom right of the chart, where we do note that debates with an initially extremely high For share tended to be won by the Against side. Of the seven debates where the For side began with at least 60% vote share, the Against side won six contests and For won only one. This is a very small sample, but it does fit our intuition, and thus the lack of bias might simply stem from the fact that it is only observed in the extreme starting positions, which occur rarely. We do note that the reverse extreme (where the Against side has initally dominant popularity) does not show any such obvious trend, which makes this slightly less troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior plot only considers the binary outcome under the ISM, but we are not solely concerned with the effect on the binary result, but rather the effect on percentage point change, which can manifest in a shift of binary result. Thus, it must be more illsutrative to break down the effect further. We create 4 bins of debates based on a partition of the initial popularity of the For camp. For each bin, we consider a box plot of the percentage change that the debate creates for the For camp along with the percentage change for the Against camp, which provides a more precise analysis. As before, the picture is muddled until we consider the final bin (debates where the For side enjoyed a 55% or more share of the support), where almost all of the changes to the For side were lesser than the changes for the Against side. This is a much more persuasively troubling result than the simple results observed above, but the sample remains small (only 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_partitionvotechange.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![PartitionVoteShare]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_partitionvotechange.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe a peculiar result, but are unsure whether it could simply result from random chance. This question of statistical significance is at the heart of the study of statistics. However, it is not immediately clear to me which tool is suited to the situation. A simple comparison of the mean changes of these different bins seems deeply problematic. It is unclear that we can make any plausible assumptions about the distribution of the changes of votes. Crucially, the changes to the For vote share are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; independent to the changes to the Against vote share. And there is a clear confounding variable, where change to For vote share is going to be effected not simply by initial For vote, but by the initial number of undecideds (we certainly have not proven this, but common sense says that an undecided voter is easier to persuade than one who believes in the opposing viewpoint). More broadly, any such test from here is problematic in the way that Exploratory Data Analysis tends to be. We have not rigorously predefined our research question based on a scientific hypothesis, we are simply confirming our vague intuition that starting vote share introduces bias. Thus, a test based on this particular binning creates some form of bias. If we explored deep enough into the data, eventualy we must have found something similarly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use a nonparametric test to examine the implausibility of the observed trend, but we must keep the bias mentioned above closely in mind. Exploratory data analysis minimizes this problem by relying on standardized statistical tests which answer broad questions. A nonparametric test that examines the statistical implausibility of the difference observed in the arbitrary binning we have chosen above is far less robust. An example statistical test is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test&#34;&gt;Kruskal-Wallis Rank test&lt;/a&gt;. This nonparametric test simply considers the ranked values of the observed data, and considers the statistical probability that we might observe such an extreme disparity as what occurs in our sample. This provides a statistically rigorous result without reliance on assumptions, but the issue is that it provides such an answer to a deeply narrow &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt;. In our case, we could consider the Kruskal-Wallis test with the changes to the For vote for two groups: those with initial share of 55+%, and those with lesser initial share. In this case, we observe a test statistic of 8.1929, and a p-value of 0.42%. Phrased in statistical language, this means that if our two groups generated changes to the For vote share with the same distribution, there would be less than a one in two hundred chance that we observe at least as large a disaparity in the ranks of the observed values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the question this answers is deceptively narrow. It cannot make any bold claims about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; debates that begin with 55+% vote share or fewer, but only the ones which we observe. If we had an ideal sample of such debates, and considered those above and below this threshold, then such a statement would be extremely powerful. Instead, our initial sample size of 11 debates means it is quite plausible that there are other fundamental differences in these samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrates the statistical significance in the difference of the distribution of these samples, but makes no claim as to why. And we have little conclusive proof that it is the prior vote share of the For side that creates this disparity, it could be any number of differences between the populations that provides the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
We can stick to a nonparametric test to sidestep of our lack of reasonable assumptions, but we must keep the above concerns closely in mind during this work. This will provide a useful benchmark for the improbability of the observed result, but there will be subjective choices made in the construction of our test (as there is no singular way to formulate our hypothesis). We must simply make reasonable choices, and keep this issue in mind (an issue at the heart of any statistical test conducted after exploratory data analysis, albeit one that is significantly less concerning when the test being used is cookie cutter and not subjectively defined by the examiner). Such 
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an obviously unsatisfying result, but in the name of intellectual honesty I hesitate to any bolder claim. Qualitatively, I do think that the sum of this analysis makes it very likely that our intuition that those with an initially high For vote share experience notable disadvantage for winning the debate under the metric used by Intelligence Squared. However, these extreme cases come up very rarely, and the ISM seems quite defensible for the purposes of the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;alternative-metrics&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course interesting to consider other metrics that one could use. Outlined above, we consider the Undisputed Metric (UDM), which instead considers the percentage that switch between each camp during the debate. The UDM declares a winner if that side converts both a greater percentage of the other side to swap, as well a greater percentage of the Undecided camp to join theirs. In cases where there is disagreement (e.g. the For side convinces a greater proportion of Against voters to join their side than vice versa, but the Against side convinces a greater proportion of Undecided voters), the UDM simply declares that there is no clear winner. The UDM operates under a fundamentally different mindset: that what matters is not the percentage point change, but the proportion of voters who you sway. As noted above, it is perfectly possible for the UDM to declare the opposite winner to the ISM (this is particularly likely to happen in those cases where one side has initially extreme vote share). We first consider another plot of the debate result under the UDM compared to the initial For and Against vote shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![UDM Box Plot](IQ2_winnerUDMresults.png) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_winnerUDMresults.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_winnerUDMresults.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the ISM, under the UDM it seems the initial popularities are overly determinative of the final result. But we do observe something of a reverse trend: if an initial side has at least 50% share of the starting vote, now they nearly always win. We again break down this effect by considering the voting shifts for debates binned by their initial For vote share. Now, our object of interest is not simply the percentage point change, but a variety of changes (in this plot, we consider the proportion of initially Against voters who shift to For, Undecided persuaded to join the For camp, and initially For voters who defect to the against side). Note that the coloring is done using our initial For popularity partition, unlike above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_UDMboxplots.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects the effects expected from our initial results. Initially high For popularity tends to imply that they will persuade a higher proportion of Against voters, and that a lower proportion of For voters will defect to Against, while the results for Undecided voters are decidedly muddled. This is what we would expect. A high initial For vote share implies a lower Against vote share, so converting a small number of Against voters shows a lower percentage point change, but a large proportional change. The movement of undecided voters does not follow this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of which side is the winner in a debate is far from straightforward. Our intuition tells us that it should depend on the performance of the debaters, and not simply reflect the initial position of the audience. This is why we do not conduct a simple exit poll on the popularity of each side, which the data shows is massively biased towards the initial popularity of the sides. Unsurprisingly, audience members have extremely strong priors on these hotly contested issues, and an hour of debate does not ovewhelm a lifetime of thought on the matter. Intelligence Squared adjusts for this bias by polling the audience before the debate, and considering the percentage point change that each side observe. We hypothesize that this may instead be biased to disfavor initially popular sides. This appears to occur in the observed data, but extreme initial popularity is relatively rare, so it is hard to precisely prove the magnitude of this effect. In fact, the data shows that this metric seems to be a reasonably fair benchmark in practice. We outline one alternative for determining the winner, which is to consider the proportional changes among each sides. Counterintuitively, it is perfectly possible for one side in a debate to lose under the Intelligence Squared system, and yet persuade a greater proportion of both Undecideds and the other side to defect. In fact, we observe this scenario in a number of debates that occur. In practice, following this metric appears to bias results in the opposite manner, where initially popular sides are again favored (although in a similarly plausibly fair way in all but extreme cases). It is worth keeping in mind that the metric used by Intelligence Squared is but one reasonable choice, and while it serves their purposes well, it should not be considered the ultimate determination of efficacy in debate. Luckily, no one would doubt that the experience of the debate is what matters, and the mark of a winner is simply a superficial afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Scraping the &#34;Intelligence Squared&#34; Debate Results</title>
      <link>/post/scraping-is2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/scraping-is2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a brief companion to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/debatefinalsummary/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; analyzing the methods of assigning a winner to a debate, using the Intelligence Squared dataset. I will briefly outline here how I assemble that dataset, for trasparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compiling-the-pages&#34;&gt;Compiling the Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from each Intelligence Squared debate are posted online in pages such as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/globalization-has-undermined-americas-working-class&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, including video of the debate, a description of the major positions of each side, the qualifications of the debaters, and most importantly, the results of the audience polling. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a central hub page that neatly lists all the URLs. However, the desired dataset isn’t huge (about 90 total debates), so there’s no substitute for the occasional work simply manually trawling through the website, and recording the date, name, and URL of each debate in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scraping-the-numbers&#34;&gt;Scraping the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have a full list of all the relevant URLs, luckily, the results themselves are generally presented in a consistent format. Thus,  some simple work with regular expressions gathers the data that we need. One such example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;debate_vote_results={&amp;quot;live&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;pre&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:36,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:45,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:19,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;post&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:32,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:61,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:7,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;s&amp;quot;:41,&amp;quot;t&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:18,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:15,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:3},&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:38,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:1},&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:8,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:8,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:3}},&amp;quot;online&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;t&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;pre&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:50,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:35,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:15,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;post&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:44,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:50,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:35,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:13,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:2},&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:4,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:27,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:4},&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:0}}};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case anyone wants to borrow this sort of simple scrape for their own projects, you can find the code 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/IntelSquaredProject/blob/master/intelsquareddata.R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, although the approach is extremely messy. Luckily, with R it’s more important to be fast than it is to be clean, and you can use very awkward code as long as you find it readable and clear. Regular expressions like this can grab the relevant numbers that we need, and we store it in one large data frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-R&#34;&gt;gsub(&amp;quot;.*\&amp;quot;f\&amp;quot;:\\{\&amp;quot;f\&amp;quot;:(\\d+\\.*\\d*),\&amp;quot;a\&amp;quot;:(\\d+\\.*\\d*),\&amp;quot;u\&amp;quot;:(\\d+\\.*\\d*).*&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;\\1 \\2 \\3&amp;quot;, post)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where we identify the numbers that we’re interested in. With the numbers compiled into one large data frame (which can be viewed in raw form 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/IntelSquaredProject/blob/master/votingresultsfinal.csv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for those interested in examining the data themselves). In total, there are 88 debates stretching back to 2012 which have all the information needed. The program itself stretches back further, but they only began tracking the subgroup movements more recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we can actually dive into the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;
