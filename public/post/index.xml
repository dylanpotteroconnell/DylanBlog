&lt;div id=&#34;introduction&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll describe my introductory exploration of Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, using Steve Scott’s &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf&#34;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt;, applied to the total weekly box office gross (i.e. ticket sales) of American movie theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is intended to help me think through and explain the concepts and methods, and is not intended as a case study with a clear goal. In fact, I’ll analyze the ways in which these models do not necessarily fit the data setting, which should highlight potential pitfalls for projects where a powerfully predictive end result is key. My aim is simply to talk through the concepts, start to flesh out my own understanding of a topic I know almost nothing about.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Thus, this is geared at those who are already comfortable with statistics and R. The explanations are for my own benefit, but others might find the explanation of the BSTS models helpful (as well as my assorted musings on theg oals of interest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this project is not a tidy and powerfully predictive model for weekly box office gross, the point is the process where we think through the limits of our inference. In fact, I purposefully do not set out a specific goal (be it long term forecasting, or interpreting the industry trends), because I want to consider how these flexible models can provide insight for many different purposes, and how that flexibility can also present subtle difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, we will show how a model with a reasonable short term forecast can provide a disastrously useless long term forecast, and that these are two very distinct challenges. This is just the tip of the iceberg for a much broader idea, but the distinction is not discussed enough. We will see that time series models must be built with their ultimate goal in mind, and different models may serve different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- As we&#39;ll see, the class of models are likely not a particularly apt fit to the domain in question. This doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no inferential value in the final result, but it does mean we have to be very conservative about what inferences we draw. BSTS models are exactly the sort of flexible structure that can provide alluringly useful accurate fits in certain contexts, only for the model to totally fall apart when stretched too far. This result is mostly due to my choice of data set (which I picked without careful consideration for its final use), but I think it&#39;s an illustrative example, because it can feel very natural to apply these models in ways which may not be theoretically sound (and they still might provide some insight in those cases, if used with appropriate caution). Above all, this is simply an opportunity for me to dip my toes into an unfamiliar topic, and I&#39;m using this post as an excuse to articulate my own understanding of the topic, and make sure I&#39;m comfortable with the basics. --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-data&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response variable is the weekly total of American theater movie ticket sales, in dollars, as tallied by &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekly/%22&#34;&gt;Box Office Mojo&lt;/a&gt;. We consider all weeks dating from 2019 back to 1993.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box Office Mojo also lists a few added goodies, like “Releases”,^{The total number of distinct movies which grossed money that week.}, the name of the “Top Release”, and whether or not it is a “Long Weekend”. For this initial exploration, we ignore these covariates, and stick to the date and the weekly gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekly.tb &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;weekly_gross.csv&amp;quot;)
select &amp;lt;- dplyr::select
weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% names()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;week&amp;quot;         &amp;quot;gross&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;top_release&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;releases&amp;quot;    
## [6] &amp;quot;long_weekend&amp;quot; &amp;quot;dates&amp;quot;        &amp;quot;start_date&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning the Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekly.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;%
  dplyr::select(start_date, gross, releases, everything())
weekly.tb %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = start_date, y = gross)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) + 
  ylab(&amp;quot;Gross ($)&amp;quot;) + 
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Weekly (American) Box Office Gross&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
Looking at the time series, we first note that there are enormous week-to-week spikes. As we will discuss in greater detail, this reflects the release of new blockbusters, and it reflects unobserved data (of course, we have some useful approximations, such as the fact that a major blockbuster is often released around Christmas). Intuitively, our lack of access shows that there is probably a great deal of irreducible uncertainty for us in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;inflation-adjustment&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation Adjustment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we note that there’s an obvious upward trend in the time series, but that doesn’t tell us much, due to the steady effects of inflation. Of course, we could simply ignore this, and rely on the model to track the effects of inflation. However, this tends to cause problems, because it conflates the trends we might care about, with those that are relatively well understood. Broadly, the interesting temporal trends will be easier to detect if we first control for the &lt;em&gt;uninteresting&lt;/em&gt; trends, like inflation. We cite the &lt;code&gt;blscrapeR&lt;/code&gt; package, and our response variable is instead the weekly gross in terms of adjusted “2019 Dollars”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- but any time series in nominal dollars is bound  but that will be true for almost there&#39;s an obvious upward trend in our time series, just about everything has gotten more expensive in the past 30 years, due to inflation. Our first step is to work with the inflation adjusted dollar weekly gross. If this cleaning step is not taken, and a time series is fit blind to the data, you can waste your time chasing after some temporal trend that simply reflects this natural increase in prices. We cite the priceR package, which can download the relevant CPI data and do the work for us.  --&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(blscrapeR)
inf_adj &amp;lt;- inflation_adjust(2019)
weekly.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% left_join(inf_adj %&amp;gt;%
                                       select(year, 
                                              adj_value) %&amp;gt;%
                                       mutate(year = as.numeric(year)),
                                     by = &amp;quot;year&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(gross_ia = gross/adj_value) %&amp;gt;%
  select(-adj_value)

weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  group_by(year) %&amp;gt;%
  summarize(`Nominal` = mean(gross),
            `Inflation Adjusted` = mean(gross_ia)) %&amp;gt;%
  ungroup() %&amp;gt;%
  pivot_longer(-year, names_to = &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;, values_to = &amp;quot;Mean Yearly Gross ($)&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Mean Yearly Gross ($)`, 
                col = Type)) + 
  xlab(&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;) + ylab(&amp;quot;Yearly Mean Gross&amp;quot;) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Yearly Mean Gross: Nominal vs Inflation Adjusted.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- # library(priceR) --&gt;
&lt;!-- #  --&gt;
&lt;!-- # weekly.tb &lt;- weekly.tb %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!-- #   mutate(gross_ia = adjust_for_inflation(gross,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- #                                          year,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- #                                          country = &#34;US&#34;,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- #                                          to_date = 2019)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the underlying trend is still real, and the surge in box office gross from the 90s through the early 2000s appears quite meaningful. But the natural inclusion of inflation does help reduce some of the impact of the trend, which may influence our modeling.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-scale-of-the-response-variable&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Scale of the Response Variable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will fit our model onto the log of the box office gross (using base 10, rather than the typical &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(e\)&lt;/span&gt;, as this has a more intuitive numerical conversion for these large decimals). Intuitively, box office cannot be negative, so if we are fitting models which assume some sort of normality, this conversion is natural. Of course, we will see that while such a conversion fixes the most glaring violation of the assumptions, that does not automatically mean that the model fits! In fact, in this exploration we will see just how difficult it is to find a tidy model for box office gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weekly.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(log_gross_ia = log10(gross_ia),
         log_gross = log10(gross))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we will plan to &lt;em&gt;evaluate&lt;/em&gt; the model on the regular scale, as we could imagine that “dollars” tend to mean more to any interested party than “log dollars” (a rather made-up measurement). I’m not sure if there is a rigorous choice here, surely it depends on the setting. But we are choosing the log transformation not because it captures the trend we care about, but because it seems to more plausibly fit the &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt; we plan to use. In this case, the model should be evaluated based on the target of interest.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Broadly, this provides good practice with how to convert from a model fit on a certain scale, to inferences drawn on another scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bayesian-structural-time-series-model&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bayesian Structural Time Series Model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this introduction, we will cite a Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) model. We can take this piece by piece. A “time series” is a sequence of data points which are indexed by time. It’s a particular category of statistics, because it fundamentally violates the core “independent and identically distributed” assumption that underpins much of statistical inference. While that renders many classical statistical procedures infeasible, the temporal relationship amongst the data is the whole point! We want to understand this evolution, which means that we must rely on a model which leverages this index on time. For notation, we write &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_1, \ldots, y_T\)&lt;/span&gt; for the response variables of interest (in this case, the log gross).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bayesian” follows its standard applied definition, as our objective is not a hypothesis test of point estimate with some desirable properties, but rather a posterior distribution on the parameters of interest (the parameters which describe our time series model). These parameters are determined by the “Structural” part of the model, whcih requires a careful definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-structural-model&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Structural” Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A “structural time series” is a model of response data indexed by time, whose temporal relationship is defined by the interplay of two equations. First, we have the &lt;em&gt;transition&lt;/em&gt; equation, which models how a latent (i.e. unobserved state) &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt; evolves over time.
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{t+1} &amp;amp;= T_t \alpha_t + R_t \eta_t, ~~~~~~ \eta_t \sim N(0, Q_t)\label{eqn:bsts_transition}
\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;
Before we explain any of these pieces, it’s best to introduce the second part, the  equation, which models how the observed response &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is generated using the state variable, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align}
y_{t} &amp;amp;= Z_t^T \alpha_t + \epsilon_t, ~~~~~~ \epsilon_t \sim N(0, H_t).\label{eqn:bsts_observation}
\end{align}\]&lt;/span&gt;
Thus, while a classic time series might model the relationship between &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_{t+1}\)&lt;/span&gt; directly, a &lt;em&gt;structural&lt;/em&gt; time series model instead links them through some latent, unobserved state, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt;, which evolves underneath unseen, and influences the observed &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sensible setup because often time series are understood to be random observations of some underlying “state” in our system, which we cannot observe directly. If you conduct monthly opinion polling with a relatively small sample, this can readily be understood as a structural time series, because the target of interest is the underlying latent state (the public’s opinion on a particular issue), while the observations are noisy datum which are heavily influenced by that latent state. Thus, it makes sense for us to model our understanding of the latent state itself, rather than the latest noisy observation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this understanding, the rest of the terms fall into place. &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Z_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt; vector, whose coefficients define the relationship between the latent state and the response (subject to the noise, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_t\)&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(T_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;state transition matrix&lt;/em&gt;, which determines the evolution of the latent state, along with the noise &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt; (with state-diffusion matrix &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(Q_t\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most general statement, and it covers a vast array of potential models. In particular, the allure of this structure is that these models are naturally &lt;em&gt;additive&lt;/em&gt;, which makes for easy modular construction. In this brief introduction, I won’t go into much detail about its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we proceed to fitting the data itself, a brief note about the normal errors, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\eta_t\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_t\)&lt;/span&gt;. The particular computational appeal of this model is that the additive composition of these normal errors allows the posterior distributions to be normal themselves. This structure allows for the use of the Kalman filter introduction quite clear.] to compute the estimate the distributions of &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\alpha_t\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_t\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of the Kalman filter (and smoother) is a bit tricky to explain, so it is ommitted here,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but the important punchline is that this model requires normally distributed errors. There is no particular reason to assume that the errors of weekly box office gross should be normally distributed! We will investigate this further, but in the use of these models, often far too little attention is paid to the model specification (as we will see that we obtain some sensible results, even with a poorly fitting model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;computation&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Computation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/bsts.pdf&#34;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; is developed by Steve Scott, and provides a host of tools to make ABDDF. His specific approach, combining the Kalman filter with a spike-and-slab prior, was introduced in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nber.org/chapters/c12995&#34;&gt;neat paper&lt;/a&gt; showing how search trends could be used to “Nowcast”.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref7&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The bsts package allows for the quick construction of common BSTS models with minimal effort, and provides a host of tools for their analysis. It’s worth noting that Tensorflow has its own package for Bayesian structural time series modeling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/sts&#34;&gt;tfp.sts&lt;/a&gt;), which provides an alternative, for those comfortable with Tensorflow, and the additional features it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;our-theoretical-model&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our Theoretical Model&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, we could simply fit the time series itself, and look at the results. First, we consider the insights of Tassone &amp;amp; Rohani on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/04/our-quest-for-robust-time-series.html&#34;&gt;Google Unofficial Data Science Blog&lt;/a&gt;. Their excellent post covers a range of topics regarding the application of time series, with a particular focus on robust systems that can be applied robustly at scale (that is, applied in a wide range of unknown situations, and provide reaonable outcomes). That is, at scale, you often do not have the luxury of considering the underlying mechanism of the time series. They cite the power of aggregating a wide range of models, whose fit onto individual components provides the desired robustness to unknown inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their goal is purely predictive, rather than inferential (i.e. “What happens?” not “Why it happens?”).&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In our case, we have the luxury of thinking about the data setting, and considering what types of models make any sense. Thus, we begin with a discussion of the limits of our inference, before considering several of the tools available, and planning which models we can fit. As we will see, our goals are not necessarily a good fit for a BSTS model! The goal of this post is simply to introduce myself to these tools, and part of that is recognizing these limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-limits-of-prediction-and-inference&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Limits of Prediction and Inference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to start with the &lt;em&gt;limits&lt;/em&gt; of the domain. If the goal of our time series was to model the Cosmic Microwave Background noise over time, we can stop right away, because it consists of entirely irreducible uncertainty, and our model has nothing to offer. More commonly, we might not have a &lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; theory of the data, but we have a rough idea of connections which might exist, and we wish to fit some models and see which have predictive and inferential merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clear limits to our capabilities given this dataset. Intuitively, the most important factor in determining the weekly box office gross has nothing to do with the general “state of the movie business”, and it has everything to do with &lt;em&gt;what movie was just released&lt;/em&gt;. This presents a significant impediment to our modeling. We have an intuitive grasp of the theory, but it’s not something that can easily be modeled! Of course, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; model the ticket sales of the biggest new release, but that’s a separate challenge, and has little to do with this time series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- In an ideal world, every modeling challenge would aim to perfectly capture the theory of the setting. In practice, we often work in situations like these. This post aims to analyze the *limits* of such an appraoch. How &#34;far&#34; can a BSTS model get us, even when we know that it is not a perfect fit for the setting? Reading about people practicing these models online, it&#39;s common to find settings with such a theoretical mismatch. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, assuming that we don’t have prescience about the release of “Avengers: Endgame”, what are some reasonable theoretical assumptions we can make? Well, first, we might expect the continuity of which movies are in theaters to provide us with a natural form of autocorrelation. The rate of decline in a movie’s second week at the same theater is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_weekend_in_box_office_performance&#34;&gt;widely studied&lt;/a&gt; phenomenom, and it is consistently between 40 and 60 percent. Now, there are dozens of movies contributing to the total weekly gross, so the relationship won’t be nearly so tidy, but this still provides a clear form of autocorrelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, we might intuitively expect there to be “trends” in the movie industry. The end of the 70s saw the rise of the blockbuster, the grosses of the biggest hits has steadily risen,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref9&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the relative popularity of different genres is always in flux. We might attempt to capture this with some sort of local slope for the latent state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we might expect there to be seasonal &lt;em&gt;weekly&lt;/em&gt; effects. Box office grosses are commonly compared to the same weeks in previous years, because of the assumption of consistent patterns. It is understood that over Christmas, many people go to the movies, whereas the theaters are comparatively dry throughout February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we could find a more nuanced understanding of the autocorrelation. By its nature, a BSTS model introduces autocorrelation, because response data which are close in time are linked by the underlying latent state. Given that we expect there to be some degree of continuity movie theaters from week to week (as movies phase in and out slowly, in addition to the aforementioned trends), this is fitting, but the point is that it is possible to be much more precise with how the autocorrelation is modeled (for instance, perhaps a sharp increase in ticket sales in one week implies a sharp drop the next, due to a single huge movie release). The point of this post is for my own education, not to actually produce the most accurate model, so I proceed with a more straightforward BSTS model here, and I will critique it if it appears to be a poor fit.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref10&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;initial-models&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Initial Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We begin by fitting a few starter models, which we can use to demonstrate the tools to analyze these models. While we will follow our insight above, we will see that without more care, there is little reason to think that these models are a precise fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can start with a local linear trend, which provides a common and flexible state space model (this is a useful starting point because of its generality, but that does not guarantee that it reflects the situation). In short, a local linear trend assumes that both the mean, the trend (i.e. the slope) of the latent state evolution are drawn from a random walk. That is, if &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt; is the mean of the latent state.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref11&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\mu_{t+1} = \mu_t + \delta_t + \epsilon_{\mu, t},
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_{\mu,t} \sim N(0, \sigma_\mu^2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is our random walk. Then, the evolution of the slope is similarly given by
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\delta_{t+1} = \delta_t + \epsilon_{\delta, t},
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_{\delta,t} \sim N(0, \sigma_\mu^2)\)&lt;/span&gt; is another random walk. How these terms relate to our overall transition and observation equations will be clear once they are combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we consider the “seasonal” model, that is, any fixed time cycle with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; possible states in the cycle). For these &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S\)&lt;/span&gt; seasons, we create an &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S-1\)&lt;/span&gt; dimension state vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_t\)&lt;/span&gt; (as we constrain the coefficients to sum to &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;) and in essence our model performs regression using these coefficients and dummy variables corresponding to the current season for the given time &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(t\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then, the first element of the season state vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\gamma_t\)&lt;/span&gt; evolves as
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\gamma_{t+1, 1} = -1*\sum_{s=2}^S \gamma_{t, s} + \epsilon_(\gamma),
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;
where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\epsilon_(\gamma) \sim N(0, \sigma_\gamma^2)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &#34;If predictor variables are present, the regression coefficients are fixed (as opposed to time varying, --&gt;
&lt;!-- though time varying coefficients might be added as state component). The predictors and response --&gt;
&lt;!-- in the formula are contemporaneous, so if you want lags and differences you need to put them in --&gt;
&lt;!-- the predictor matrix yourself.&#34; -bsts Docs --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these two commponents, we can fit our twin initial models. Our “season” model consists of just the seasonal component, with &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(S=52\)&lt;/span&gt; allowing a regression on every single unique week of the year, and the “LLT” model adding to that a local linear trend. When just using the seasonal model, we need to add to it a static intercept term, so that the mean isn’t wildly off. While the purpose of this is more educational than anything else, it’s useful to be clear on what this could show. Comparing these models essentially takes for granted the folk wisdom that the precise week of the year influences the “state” of ticket sales. Then, comparing these models can help understand if there is some basis for tracing local trends in the movie business, or if that is just overfitting to noise.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref12&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; package makes fitting these models extremely easy. The “state specification” is a list of state components. We construct a seasonal state space, add a static intercept, and fit the model. This post is meant as a reminder of the underlying theory, so it won’t go into the technical details of what the model produces (which are covered in the documentation), but broadly the model object which results from bsts() contains the relevant parameters and samples from the posterior distribution which we want (with the one technical caveat that it returns all iterations of its posterior sampler, so if you want to access those samples yourself, you need to remove the burn-in segment manually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.season &amp;lt;- AddSeasonal(list(), 
                         weekly.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                         nseasons = 52)
ss.season.intercept &amp;lt;- AddStaticIntercept(ss.season,
                                          weekly.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.season &amp;lt;- bsts(weekly.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                     state.specification = ss.season.intercept,
                     niter = 500, 
                     ping = 0, 
                     seed = 21)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the models are modular, to create our local linear trend state specification, we simply add the local linear trend to our already specified seasonal component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.llt &amp;lt;- AddLocalLinearTrend(ss.season,
                              weekly.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.llt &amp;lt;- bsts(weekly.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                  state.specification = ss.llt,
                  niter = 500, 
                  ping = 0, 
                  seed = 21)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Comparing the Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should first be said that models cannot be analyzed in isolation. In practice, we should begin by specifying our goals, and the costs associated with poor results. Here, we sketch out some relevant tools to analyze these forecasts, recognizing that their actual application is dependent on the specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-bsts-package-tools&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; Package Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; package comes preloaded with useful functions for analysis of the results. We start with &lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModels()&lt;/code&gt;, which charts the cumulative absolute error of our one-step predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModels(list(Seasonal = model.season, 
                       LLT = model.llt))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;
With a single line of code, we can see how the additional flexibility of the local linear trend does indeed make our predictions more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re unfamiliar with BSTS models, it’s not immediately clear what exactly this is measuring, and it’s important to be very precise. “Cumulative absolute error” is clear enough, but what errors is it referring to? These are the “one-step-ahead” prediction errors, where the data points are drawn from the posterior computed by the Kalman filter. Unfortunately, we can’t be too rigorous about this description without going into the theoretical details of the filter, but the gist is that the Kalman filter computes the posterior distribution for the next response data point, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p(y_t | y_{1:t-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;, recursively through the posterior on the latent state posterior, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p(\alpha_t | y_{1:t-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref13&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Our model object contains posterior draws (in our case, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(500\)&lt;/span&gt; of them) for each posterior distribution &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(p(y_t | y_{1:t-1})\)&lt;/span&gt;. The “errors” above are the difference between these posterior samples, and the actual observed data point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poses a problem for applying this function directly to our setting. The mean absolute prediction errors are computed on the response data, which are logarithms, whereas we are most likely interested in errors on the regular scale. The fix is simply to grab the relevant parts of the &lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModels()&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdrr.io/cran/bsts/src/R/compare.bsts.models.R&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;, and do a bit of surgery until it suits our purpose. We take the one-step errors directly from the model object, and remove the burn-in. Then, we convert from posterior errors in the log scale, to posterior errors on the regular scale. If such a log-scale posterior error is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{e}\)&lt;/span&gt;, our response (in regular scale, not log) as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt;, and our predicted value as &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{y}\)&lt;/span&gt;, we have &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\hat{e} = \log_{10} \hat{y} - \log_{10}y\)&lt;/span&gt;. Thus, the errors we want are given by
&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\hat{e} &amp;amp;= \log_{10} \hat{y} - \log_{10}y\\
\hat{y} - y &amp;amp;= 10^{\hat{e}}y -y = (10^{\hat{e}}-1)y.
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, this transformation doesn’t radically change the picture, it’s still measuring the same errors. But the units of absolute error are now interpretable, the difference between the two is more clear, and there could be cases where computing the errors based on the logs would lead to unintuitive results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as we keep repeating, one should think carefully about the goals of the analysis. The cumulative error is an intuitive metric, but it’s not particularly Bayesian (as it is computed using a simple point estimate on the posterior). If the ultimate output of the model is a sequence of these point estimates, then it is a sensible place to start. If the goal is to construct a full posterior probability that captures the theoretical situation, it won’t be very meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; package offers a &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdrr.io/cran/bsts/man/plot.bsts.html&#34;&gt;variety of other plotting tools&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;code&gt;PlotBstsComponents()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PlotBstsForecastDistribution()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PlotSeasonalEffect()&lt;/code&gt;, and more), but they didn’t appear very informative when applied directly out of the box to this data set. Which isn’t surprising, it’s hard to write general purpose plotting functions. In almost all cases, it’s better to construct your own, to tackle the task at hand.

&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we can see that the seasonal model is more conservative, and sticks with the broadly known weekly trends. It predicts spikes at major holidays, but otherwise misses on the unexpected micro trends. The LLT model &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make an attempt to predict these large spikes. It’s a very difficult task given the data, so we only see a moderate improvement in the MAPE. They represent two different philosophies, and the choice might depend on the specific goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these are simply fitting point estimates, the means of the one-step posterior predictive distributions. In the tutorials I saw online, this was the the typical example used (with posterior distributions cited for the coefficients themselves), but we do have a full distribution to work with. We consider the rate of coverage for the 95% credible intervals for both distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CheckOneStepCalibration(tb.season)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that neither one-step calibration is what we would hope, with only about 75% and 72%, respectively, for the seasonal and LLN model predictions capturing the observed data within their credible interval. We also see that the slight advantage in MAPE for the more flexible model evaporates under this perspective, which makes sense: the more aggressive model sometimes tries to “predict” a release that doesn’t occur. This helps slightly with its MAPE, but means it is more likely to whiff entirely in the credible interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These credible intervals are not well calibrated, and it is not particularly surprising. We know there is a large amount of irreducible uncertainty in the system that our model does not capture. Ultimately, for a properly calibratd model, we would need to restructure it from these composition of normal models, to something that represents the theory of the system itself. It’s certainly notable that the seasonal effect alone seems to capture most of the variability, and that the addition of a local trend doesn’t appear to be significantly superior (depending on our goals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is there any use to these models at all? We might consider the argument by a skeptic, who thinks that the additional assumptions we pose are misguided, and the simplest of models is just as apt. Such a model would consist solely of a static intercept (note, it is not simply a flat model, it still has our composition of normal components, just without a trend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we follow the same basic evaluative steps as above, we can see that the static intercept model has about 25% MAPE (compared to 16% before), and about 10 percentage point drop in coverage by the credible interval. Clearly, the flexibility afforded by our seasonal modeling adds to the predictive power. However, as we’d expect, the models shown above are quite flawed, and the fact that they are not too many miles ahead of the static model is cause for further scrutiny of our theoretical setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- I&#39;m still a little uncertain on this part, I actually thought that the mean one-step posterior predictive value of a static model might be fixed, should investigate further. --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coefficients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, predictive power is not the only allure of constructing such a Bayesian model. While not the focus of this exploration, we can also examine the resulting model coefficients. In this case, we take a peak at the seasonal coefficients that result from the pure seasonal model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;burn &amp;lt;- SuggestBurn(.1, model.season)
components &amp;lt;- cbind.data.frame(

  weekly.tb$start_date)  
names(components) &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Seasonality&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at box plots for each of the 52 weeks, showing their spread. We also consider the visual trend of the week coefficients over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;components %&amp;gt;% mutate(week_number = row_number() %% 52) %&amp;gt;%

&lt;p&gt;We can observe the typically expected trends. While January is a strong month (due to Oscars hits being in theaters, and the tail end of Christmas), theaters hit a low during the early months of the year, before surging at summer, lagging in the fall, and surging again around Christmas.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref14&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;brief-mention-of-long-term-forecasting&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brief Mention of Long Term Forecasting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this exploration, I have mentioned how I am being purposefully fuzzy about the goals of the model. It is important to emphasize that, because in any real application, these goals would have to be foregrounded in the construction of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; model (whereas the point of this post is to just explore the tools). One example of this is in a critical distinction between types of prediction: forecasting in the long run, and forecasting the next step (or “nowcasting”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Olavson’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2019/12/humans-in-loop-forecasting-integrating.html&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on the objective automation of forecasting helps clarify this distinction. He calls the long run objective “strategic forecasting, which has low update frequency, uncertainty which is difficult to quantify, and whose outputs are used in high stakes decision making (with significant human interpretation). By comparison,”tactical forecasting&amp;quot; is a mostly automated process, making countless micro predictions at scale, whose automation can be guided by frequent backtesting (and related strategies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, it seems that Bayesian Structural Time Series models should be perfectly serviceable at either goal. The original paper by Scott &amp;amp; Varian focuses on the short term nowcasting, but the interpretability of the Bayesian framework makes longer term forecasts a reasonable application. However, the models may be built quite differently when we keep these goals in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implicitly, our work this far has been geared towards tactical forecasting, using the model to construct point estimates for each subsequent time step, relying on a relatively flexible fit to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our full model computed earlier uses the Kalman smoother and is fit over &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the data. Thus, to get a sense of how this might work for forecasting, we need to turn to a training and test set structure. We pick the cut-off arbitrarily at the end of 2016 (we would hope that the model is relatively agnostic about this choice, but we will see that in this case, it is not). In a more serious application, it would likely make sense to compute models for a sequence of forecast cut-offs, but this choice is just for a quick demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cutoff &amp;lt;- 2016
# Divide into &amp;quot;training&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;test&amp;quot; set (for forecasting)
train.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(year &amp;lt;= cutoff)
test.tb &amp;lt;- weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(start_date &amp;gt; cutoff)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We again compute the same two models as before. The 52 week seasonal model, with a static intercept (just on the training data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.season.train &amp;lt;- AddSeasonal(list(), 
                               train.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                               nseasons = 52)
ss.season.intercept.train &amp;lt;- AddStaticIntercept(ss.season.train,
                                                train.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.season.train &amp;lt;- bsts(train.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                           state.specification = ss.season.intercept.train,
                           niter = 500, 
                           ping = 0, 
                           seed = 21)

p.season &amp;lt;- predict.bsts(model.season.train, 
                         horizon = weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow() - 
                           train.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the model where we add a local linear trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss.llt.train &amp;lt;- AddLocalLinearTrend(ss.season.train,
                                    train.tb$log_gross_ia)
model.llt.train &amp;lt;- bsts(train.tb$log_gross_ia, 
                        state.specification = ss.llt.train,
                        niter = 500, 
                        ping = 0, 
                        seed = 21)
p.llt &amp;lt;- predict.bsts(model.llt.train, 
                      horizon = weekly.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow() - 
                        train.tb %&amp;gt;% nrow())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now use the &lt;code&gt;bsts&lt;/code&gt; built in feature for plotting these forecasts, showing the fitted values and credible intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(p.season, plot.original = 52*2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2020-05-28-bsts-boxofice.en/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real punchline here is that both models make moderately similar projections for the next few years. However, the plots aren’t too revealing yet, and we want to compare them to the observed values.
We can rework our earlier functions to now compute MAPE for both fitted and predicted. Now, in addition to the credible interval (for both the one-step predictions, and the future forecasts), we zoom in on the time period which is forecast (based on our training data, up until the end of 2016).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that both seem to offer reasonably useful forecasts, with calibration (over the entire period, combining both one-step and forecasts)\footnote[Perhaps these should be separated, I haven’t found resources discussing the best way to evaluate these models.] in a similar range as before, and the forecast range seemingly capturing much of the observed trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the particular difference between the two models becomes clear in the distant forecast. The seasonal model is more consistent, with fairly static uncertainty. With the addition of the local linear trend, we become more confident in the short run, but have much less confidence once we project several years out. This is because the local linear trend is extremely flexible, which becomes particularly apparent when considering outcomes several years away. Whether the state of the movie business is sufficiently static for this to be a poor assumption will depend on who you ask.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref15&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;not-far-from-madness&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not Far From Madness?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our starter models continue to perform moderately well (if unexceptionally), it is illustrative to consider how easy this modeling can go badly wrong. It only takes a few wrong choices for a model to go from simply incomplete, to totally nonsensical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, what happens if we remove our seasonal correction, and left the local linear trend in to capture this seasonal variation? As the movie industry heats up in the summer months, perhaps the local linear trend is sufficient to capture that growth. We certainly would expect our accuracy to decrease, we’ve established that the week of the year is a critical predictor of the weekly gross. However, what we’ll see below is that the removal of the seasonal adjustment makes the model &lt;em&gt;completely useless&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to longer term forecasting, not simply “inaccurate”.&lt;/p&gt;

We can see that the results are completely nonsensical. It is a little more clear when using the built in prediction plots (although the dates are removed, I didn’t have time to add those back in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(p.base, plot.original = 52*2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recall that the original series is on the &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; scale, which helps clarify the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intuitive explanation is straightforward enough. Without the seasonal adjustment, the local linear trend has learned from the data that there is great variability. The slope is constantly changing direction, multiple times per year, so it assigned a large variance in its movements. Without observing any new data, this uncertainty compounds, as the model thinks that the slope could be rapidly growing, or rapidly falling. And worse, this all happens on that log scale. So we quickly see the range of uncertainty about the state state double and triple in log units, which leads to absurd credible intervals for the future predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting about this is that our short run predictions are not so impossible. We can see in the comparison below that the model without seasonality is clearly inferior, but it simply looks like simply a moderate step down. It’s only once we take stab at long term forecasting that we see that the use of a local linear trend without a seasonal adjustment fully breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CompareBstsModelsLog(list(`LLT + Seasonal` = model.llt.train,
                          `LLT Without Seasonal` = model.base))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reiterates the aforementioned discussion in Thomas Olavson’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2019/12/humans-in-loop-forecasting-integrating.html&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, distinguishing tactical and strategic forecasting. He discusses the great theoretical and practical differences between the two challenges. This frivolous example is simply a reminder of how easy theoretical models can break, when we are careless with the data. Long term forecasting requires more theoretical care, as we cannot rely on automatic processes fitting relevant patterns in the data and avoiding disaster. Poor theoretical assumptions will lead to useless forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Exploring the Autocorrelation --&gt;
&lt;!-- One challenge is that these effects are all closely related. The introduction of regular seasonal effects can mask effects of auto correlation. To be honest, I don&#39;t know the best way to solve this. Eventually, the model should be well equipped to sort them out, but in the exploration stage, it&#39;s not so clear. For now, I will simply resort to a crude method at de-seasoning the model, by normalizing the grosses by the mean gross for each of the 52 weeks. This should help uncover autocorrelative effects. However, the model itself will be fit on data without this adjustment, because it will apply a more delicate (and Bayesian) treatment to these seasonal terms. I&#39;m curious what the best pratice here would be.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- weekly.tb &lt;- weekly.tb %&gt;%  --&gt;
&lt;!--   group_by(week) %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--   mutate(week_mean_ia = mean(gross_ia)) %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--   ungroup() %&gt;% --&gt;
&lt;!--   mutate(gross_ia_week_adj = gross_ia - week_mean_ia + mean(gross_ia)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- We use the Acf function from the &#34;forecast&#34; package, which computes the correlation of the data for each &#34;lag&#34; (the number of steps back). Thus, we can see here that there is a strong positive correlation between the inflation adjusted weekly gross and the previous week, but once you get to around 10 weeks or so, the correlation becomes negative (if slight).  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- library(forecast) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Acf(weekly.tb$gross_ia) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- However, this is applied to our original data, and the presumed seasonal effects might be causing potential problems. When we instead compute an ACF plot for the week-normalized gross, we see instead that the positive autocorrelation is *consistent*. This makes a good deal of sense. The 10 to 15 weeks we were looking at above is a long enough period of time, that you essentially switch &#34;movie seasons&#34;. Thus, intuitively it fits that there might be some negative correlation, as the low point of the movie year (around February and March), are roughly 10-20 weeks offset from some of the busiest movie times (Christmas, and the summer, in the two directions). --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- Acf(weekly.tb$gross_ia_week_adj) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;
&lt;!-- This local trend is typical of most time series models, but we might want to consider a slightly more advanced version.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Now, we apply [differencing](https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html)  --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using time series for forecasting is an exceptionally tricky endeavor, and this post is just a brief introduction as I dip my toe into the field. Looking at how time series are used publicly online can often give you the sense that it’s a matter of plugging the data into a flexible model, fitting the curve, and hoping for the best. However, it’s important to be precise about the inferential goals of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punch line from this analysis might simply be “don’t cite a Bayesian time series when the specified joint probability model doesn’t naturally reflect our best understanding of the underlying process”. And that might be fair, outside of an introductory context I would be hesitant to say much of anything about such a tenuous approaach to modeling (I’d probably tell my boss just to take a look at the movies that are coming out, and see if he recognizes the names, before I try and use past data to predict the weekly box office gross!). But these models are often applied in imperfect ways, and I’ve found it illustrative to work carefully through one such example, and try and understand the mechanics of the model under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the distinction between long run and short term forecasting is critical. They are markedly different challenges, which call for different tools and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Eric Tassone &amp; Farzan Rohani provide an insightful [blog post](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2017/04/our-quest-for-robust-time-series.html) examining the way that time series forecasting can and should cite ensemble averaging. --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, I may work professionally on projects along these lines, but I made sure to finish writing this before I saw this in a professional setting, as at that point I might have to think about what I could share.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I.e. my lifetime.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is an incredibly obvious correction, and I left it until now mostly to make a point about an easy but damaging mistake, it’s also not quite so apparent that it is a perfect and tidy fix. Between the 90s and today, it likely is sufficient, but there are other notable societal changes that can make comparing ticket sales difficult.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we evaluate this transformation, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error becomes nonsensical, where being off by a factor of two leads to only a small penalty.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not classical time series don’t have good ways of handling this problem too! While it would indeed be foolish to consider the prior observation, the sole piece of information denoting the current state, time series models have a rich array of tools to handle these complex forms of autocorrelation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn6&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://eml.berkeley.edu/~rothenbe/Fall2007/kalman.pdf&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; quite helpful.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn7&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting an unobserved response occurring in the given moment&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn8&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I use “Predictive” to refer to the task of forecasting the future response (including in the very next step), and “Inferential” to refer to understanding trends in the data (e.g. the posterior distribution of the parameters in a sensible Bayesian model should provide useful inference.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn9&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we will see in a later section, this deserves more careful consideration.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn10&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I return to this dataset, my next approach will focus on explicitly modeling the structure of the autocorrelation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn11&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of this is grabbed right from the bsts manual, whose documentation is very helpful.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn12&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if neither model captures the situation, this inference can be complicated, but it’s still useful to explore the area.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn13&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(y_{1:t} := (y_1, \ldots, y_t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, matching the typical Kalman filter notation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn14&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am still not entirely confident about the interpretation of these plots, will return soon to clear this up.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn15&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, it has likely been too consistent for this to be sensible, but given that this is being written as the movie industry is shut down during COVID-19, greater tail uncertainty doesn’t seem unreasonable.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WORK IN PROGRESS, scattered notes/plots here visualized, will be turned into proper post soon. Aims to explain in layman’s terms the way that the addition of noise can help gradient descent escape spurious optima (and how this has an intuitive interpretation in our own lives)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;outline&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Outline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note, this was openly inspired by the writings of Tim Harford. I ound his descriptiption of the London Tube Strike and its implications while struggling through the study of Langevin diffusions, and I had been meaning to try and show some visualizations of noisy optimization for a while. He’s a wonderful popular economics communicator, and a lot of fun to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, try and think of any and all images you can include! minimize text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-perfect-scrambled-eggs&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Perfect Scrambled Eggs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(or “our optimized lives”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[rw]My morning routine is perfectly optimized, a blend of art and science. I’ve settled on an order in which to take the ingredients for scrambled eggs, the exact selection of dishes to use to minimize washing, and the fact that my silver bowl has sides just low enough that beaten egg could escape, and that raw eggs go in the red bowl. I didn’t set out to figure this out, I just made scrambled eggs every morning for years, and over time saw tiny choices that make it go a little smoother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;disruption-and-the-london-subway-strike&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Disruption, and the London Subway Strike&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 4th, 2014, the workers of the London Tube (their underground subway), went on strike, forcing a number of station closures throughout the city. For three days, a subset of commuters found their usual routes to work blocked, and were forced to find alternatives. After the strike, the stations reopened, and life went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But three economists saw the opportunity for a natural experiment: only certain commuters were disrupted by the closure, and using the tracking data collected by the Tube, their movements could be compared to the unaffected group. And surprisingly, life &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; go right back to normal after the ending of the strike. The ID card data showed that some of the impacted group stuck with their newly discovered routes, and their commuting time decreased as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The station closures forced commuters to break from their finely tuned routines, but a surprising number found themselves dragged unnwillingly along a route that proved faster than the one they had been taking for years. The economists even claim that on net, the strike decreased the total commuting time.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Even if only a small fraction found new routes, their new route would benefit them for years to come, and taking this chance only required disruption for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story provides a neat way to frame the mathematical challenge of optimization, and in particular, why so many optimization algorithms involve &lt;em&gt;random noise&lt;/em&gt;, a choice which initially seems bizarre. I’ll begin by describing how to think about optimization in intuitive terms, and then detail how that corresponds with the common mathematical algorithms, and why the London Tube Strike provides a neat analogy to very real mathematical properties.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-mathematical-framework-of-optimization&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Mathematical Framework of Optimization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- This is duplicate with above? --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to show how this concept can be naturally articulated in a mathematical framework.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We are describing the challenge of optimization. Here’s a sample definition, from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/mathematical-optimization&#34;&gt;DeepAI website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mathematical optimization is the process of maximizing or minimizing an objective function by finding the best available values across a set of inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For London commuters, their “objective function” might be the duration of the commute,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the “available values across a set of inputs” might be the route they take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we want to find the highest peak in a mountain range (an example we’ll discuss in detail in the next section), the input might be the choice of latitude and longitude, and the objective the elevation at that point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When baking chocolate chip cookies, the possible inputs might be the amount of each ingredient, and the order in which they are combined, and the objective function might be the tastiness of the resulting cookie. This isn’t quite a joke, Google once ran a &lt;a href=&#34;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46507.pdf&#34;&gt;cookie optimization experiment&lt;/a&gt; along these lines.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization is vitally important in applied mathematics and statistics, but it can be quite hard. The vast increase in computational power has broadened our horizons for what optimization challenges are possible, but many useful problems remain out of our reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, in optimization, we assume that we can check the value of the objective function at some chosen input. We can try a certain route on the subway and time the duration, we can bake a batch of cookies and eat them, and we will imagine that we have some computer which takes in latitude and longitude coordinates and spits out the altitude (this is called a “query” to the objective function, or perhaps “oracle”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our naive optimization strategy might be to just try a bunch of points. Maybe we can define a grid of latitude and longitude coordinates, check the elevation of each one, and pick the highest. But this naive approach only works when the potential choices of input are sufficiently narrow. In particular, we look at the “dimension” of the input space. Latitude and longitude represent a mere 2-dimensions. The number of points within an exhaustive “grid” of inputs grows exponentially with the dimension of the input. Cookies are comprised by some dozen ingredients. The famous Jacques Torres &lt;a href=&#34;https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015819-chocolate-chip-cookies&#34;&gt;cookie recipe&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(12\)&lt;/span&gt; ingredients. If we wanted to try all combinations of a mere five levels of each ingredient, that would be over two hundred thousand possibilities, which is a bit much for even the hungriest baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly confronting optimization challenges in our own life, and we rarely take this naive approach. Instead, we tend to look for small &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; optimizations, whose benefits we can easily identify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- * Finding the best route on the subway is something we optimize. While often algorithmic services can do the work for us, in other cases (or the past), we have to figure it out ourselves, and we somehow pick our starting point. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * For an example, let&#39;s imagine we want to find the highest point in a mountain range. We can check an individual point, and see how high it is. How do we find the highest point? The analogy would be something like, instead of latitude and longitude in a mountain range, in our morning routine it would be that &#34;series of choices for how we get to work&#34;.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Now, imagine instead of querying a computer for the height, you yourself were actually in that mountain range. What would you do? Well, you&#39;d look for the peak, but what if you were in a forest? You&#39;d go up. Specifically, you would look at the area around you for *local* guidance. --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;locality-in-optimization&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Locality in Optimization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we bite into a warm cookie, and the text the texture is just right, but there’s not enough chocolate.(more flowery language here?) We wouldn’t just throw up our hands and start from scratch… we’d add more chocolate! It’s hard to look at a cookie recipe, and imagine what the result will taste like. But we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; taste a recipe, and imagine what a small tweak would taste like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “locality” in optimization refers to “closeness” in the input space. In latitude and longitude, this would be literal distance, while the definitions are a bit less cookie in the space of cookie ingredients and subway commutes. Broadly, we are pretty good at understanding. If we increase the amount of chocolate, we now they’ll taste a bit more chocolate-y than they do now. If we increase the amounts of chocolate, butter, baking soda, reduce the amount of flour, and tweak the balance between brown and cane sugar, are we confident we know what the result will taste like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the London Tube experiment, the researchers place some of the blame on the “stylized nature” of the Tube map displayed to commuters. Its spatial distortions make it difficult to spot major inefficiencies in their route, without some external push. By comparison, we can usually estimate the impact of these “local” changes by ourselves. If we get off one stop earlier, maybe our walk to work increases by a minute but we avoid the wait at a crowded station. These slight changes are a bit like increasing just a single ingredient in a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;london_tube_map.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, this describes my relationship with my own food. TO ADD MORE…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my own life, I find this with food all the time. I have a set rotation of dishes I love, that fit my criteria (hassle-free ingredients, saves well for leftoers, etc). I’m happy to make small chaanes to what I eat. I recently realized how well a lone, unadorned sweet potato went with some of my staples. That’s a one step addition, and I can evaluate its impact as I walk the aisles of the store. Sure enough, it quickly became a staple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, I’m sure there are many full dishes out there that would be just as good as my current rotation. But to find a new dish is a risk. There’s no way for me to see all the the links in the chain. Will the ingredients be easy to find? Will I find the cooking burdensome? What will the end result taste like? Are my cooking supplies well suited to the task?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- * We provide some new rules of the game. We know not only the value at these points, we know the shape/slope/etc of the area around it. This is a reasonable relaxation, because we can estimate this shape by querying our computer for the values of the areas near our point (are we going up or down). The rule is that we can&#39;t look far away to see where the peak is (perhaps we&#39;re stuck in the Appalachian forests, and not the sheer granite of the Sierra Nevada).  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * This isn&#39;t arbitrary, it&#39;s a natural understanding of how we actually operate. We are inherently *local* optimizers. We can easily assess the impact of small changes, not not large ones. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * On a morning commute, we can estimate whether taking a turn a few blocks early to avoid a stoplight saves us time. It&#39;s much harder to figure out in advance whether taking the bus or train is easy. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Now, I&#39;d wager that generally, we&#39;re rather good at making small (later, we will call these &#34;local&#34;, due to their geometric interpretation) adjustments. If I realize that by taking a right a few blocks early, I can avoid the long traffic light, I&#39;ll often do it.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * However, there&#39;s a reason these are small changes. We can estimate their impact from where we are. If we considered an entirely new route to work, taking a whole different train line, we would have no way to know what that&#39;s like. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before, we imagined a challenge where we tried to find a peak of a mountain range, using a computer which could tell us the elevation of any chosen input point. Let’s imagine that it also tells us the slope of the incline at that point (“which direction is down”). This better reflects our intuition for local optimization, but it’s also not a large change to the game, because we could always simply query the elevation in a small area around our point, and gauge the slope ourselves. Imagine that we are hiking with an altimeter, and we can look around us and see the shape of the nearby slope. However, we can’t just look around and find a faraway peak, because we’re stuck in the forests of the Appalachians rather than the sheer granite ofthe Sierra Nevada. Our intuition tells us the optimization algorithm which is natural: from wherever we are, “go up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;gradient-ascent&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gradient Ascent&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intuitive is called “gradient ascent”. Wherever you are, go up. This is quite literal in the case of our mountain range, This section will provide its mathematical definition, but these details aren’t important, and you can skip the notation and go straight to the visualizations if you’d like. We begin with the intuitive description, and below write the algorithm out mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bit more detail, we begin at some initial point. We find the direction of steepest ascent from that point, i.e. up the hill (the magnitude and direction of steepest ascent form the “gradient” vector). Then, we walk for a period in that direction (the amount is determined by the “step size”, and how steep the ascent actually is). Once we finish walking, we are at a new point, and we repeat this process again (we determine direction of steepest ascent, and walk in that direction). Once we reach a point that is essentially flat, there is no more direction of steepest ascent to follow, and we are done (this is called “convergence”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the intuitive definition of what it means to make &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; changes. Wherever we are, we think “what small change could we make to make this better?” If our cookies are too salty, we add a bit less salt, but we don’t start over from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mathematical-definition&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mathematical Definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- Some explanation of continuous vs discrete space would be nice? --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine we are at some point &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\)&lt;/span&gt; (meaning, &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; is a point in &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(d\)&lt;/span&gt;-dimensional space).
(Maybe in English first?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mathematical definition of a crude version of gradient descent.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref6&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\)&lt;/span&gt; be our objective function. Let &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\eta &amp;gt; 0\)&lt;/span&gt; be our scaling constant. We begin at some initial point &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x^{(0)} \in \mathbb{R}^d\)&lt;/span&gt;. For &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k = 0, \ldots,\)&lt;/span&gt;, until convergence, repeat steps 2 through 4(?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute the gradient &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\nabla f(x^{(k)})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x^{(k+1)} \leftarrow x^{(k)} + \eta \nabla f(x^{(k)})\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\nabla f(x^{(k)})\)&lt;/span&gt; is sufficiently small, halt the algorithm, and select &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(x^{(k+1)}\)&lt;/span&gt; as our optima. Otherwise, set &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(k \leftarrow k+1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and repeat steps 2-4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;visualizing-gradient-ascent&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualizing Gradient Ascent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to say that we follow the direction of steepest ascent, but what does that actually look like in practice? Imagine we have to summit a hill. This one is perfectly round, for simplicitly, but pretend we don’t know that, we can only see the local area around us.
&lt;!-- Need to go through and do better labels/etc for all these visualizations!  --&gt;s
&lt;!-- (Show the unimodel 2d case ) --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a contour plot, like what you find on a topographical map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be more clear if we consider viewing the map at an angle (thanks to the &lt;code&gt;rayshader&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tylermw.com/3d-ggplots-with-rayshader/&#34;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;uni_vis_3d.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine we start at that red dot in the top right. We look around, and see that the direction of steepest ascent is down and to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this simple example, our local minimization strategy (“just go up!”) finds the highest peak without any trouble. However, not all mountain ranges are quite so friendly. Imagine there were three different peaks, of differing heights. It’s a bit harder to picture, but there’s a 3D visualization after the contour plot to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;SGD, and Neural Nets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have seen randomization introduced quite literally, by a random movement. But randomization is often introduced less explicitly into popular algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural networks are the much heralded staple of the rise of machine learning. Their optimization, perhaps consistent of millions or billions of dimensions (we considered a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; dimension for visualization purposes above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft boasted of a neural network with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/zero-deepspeed-new-system-optimizations-enable-training-models-with-over-100-billion-parameters/&#34;&gt;17 billion(!)&lt;/a&gt; parameters, each of which are a dimension to be optimized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is an enormous amount of potential spurious optima.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we’ve found over the past decade, SGD works “unreasonably well”. It’s explicitly an algorithm for convex optimization, and yet it optimizes these deep networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are a variety of complex answers, depending on who you ask, but the staple reason which dates back &lt;a href=&#34;https://leon.bottou.org/publications/pdf/nimes-1991.pdf&#34;&gt;decades&lt;/a&gt; is that its inherent noisiness allows it to escape spurious local optima.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref8&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The noisiness comes not fro our explicit introduction, but from the its approximation error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The noise of SGD has little analogy in our own lives, but the way that noise becomes a tool, not a hindrance, in non-convex optimization, is very real.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGD is the staple way to optimize neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pointed self help message would say to fine and embrace randomness. But with no such agenda, I can say that’s true, but also incredibly hard to get right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;just look at the gif! this is all powerful theory, but hard to chose the right way to introduce noise. in a clean, mathematical scenario, we can study the sorts of noise that are optimal, without any cost. when it comes to our own personal life, we experience this noise as disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous computer scientist Alan Perlis said “Optimization hinders evolution”, and it’s true. This is the fundamental “explore vs exploit” trade-off. We could spend our energy searching for better strategies (“explore”), or we could focus on deriving the benefit from the currently known optimal strategy (“exploit”). In almost every application, there is a trade-off, and it’s very hard to get right. I think our status quo bias and inherently “local” perspective means we’ll typically err on the side of spending too little time exploring, but of course it’s hard to know how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the takeaway could be something as simple as welcoming disruption, rather than resisting it. There’s no point in getting mad at a change to your commute, the world won’t notice (cite quote?), but maybe you can use the simple platitude that this is the necessary phase of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrambled eggs are a wonderful way to start my morning. I doubt there’s much more room to optimize the way I enjoy them. But I’d be foolish to think that there weren’t wildly different options that were just as rewarding. [rw]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Parlays and Independence </title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betting parlays of positively correlated events will generally be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is far from revolutionary, and will be obvious to those familar with the fundamentals of betting. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to many folks with no prior experience who wanted to learn more. I thought it would be interesting and fun to write up a basic tutorial in this concept which assumes minimal background in probability (and should provide good intuition even with no mathematical foundation). This post is intended as an exercise in explaining concepts at an introductory level, and should be ignored by those who are already comfortable with the tools of probability (although many might find the 2018 election parlay opportunities of interest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;betting&#34;&gt;Betting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are familiar with the concept of a bet. I might flip a coin, and the loser pays the winner a dollar, which feels like a fair deal. Implicit in our evaluation of this bet as &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; is the concept of Expected Value (EV). While this will avoid the mathematical definition whenever possible, we tend to have an intuitive sense of EV when we confront it in our daily lives. The fact that the coin flipping game is &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; is obvious due to its symmetry. But if I instead offered to roll a die, and said that on a one through four you pay me a dollar, and on a five or six I pay you two dollars, many people would intuitively see this bet as fair as well. I have twice the chance to win, but have to pay out twice as much. Mathematically, we simply find the sum of all the outcomes multiplied by their probability of occurrence. I have \(2/3\) chance to pay you a dollar, and \(1/3\) chance to win two dollars, and \(-1*\frac{2}{3} + 2*\frac{1}{3} = 0\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to betting, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that Expected Value is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; viable way to consider the outcome, and any other metric is bound to be a losing strategy in the long run. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it applies in every practical situation. If I offered you a deal where I would double your life&amp;rsquo;s savings with a 55% chance, and you would lose it all with 45% chance, this is clearly a positive expected value bet, and it is also one that you should demonstrably &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; take. The marginal utility of money states that the value of doubling your life savings does not equate to the loss from losing your life&amp;rsquo;s savings. This is a reminder that betting is particularly problematic in any situation where the stakes are not so low that you can focus solely on EV. If someone offered you the same deal on each of your individual dollars in your life savings independently, then it would be a consistently profitable proposition with essentially no downside, due to the law of large numbers. (And if one&amp;rsquo;s life savings is not suitably large so that the law of large numbers applies, betting should be far from your mind). This is not the purpose of this summary, but for anyone who does plan to place bets, it is essential that they give some preliminary consideration to the marginal utility of money, bankroll management, and the law of large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;betting-notation&#34;&gt;Betting Notation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In America, bets are usually denoted using the Moneyline system, where odds are reported in the form of \(\pm X-[\)hundred]. A +\(200\) line says that if you bet \$100 and win, you receive back \$200 plus your original bet. A \(-250\) line says that if you bet \$250 and win, you win \$100 (and of course also win back your original bet). This system makes it intuitive to measure your payout on a specific bet, but it is somewhat opaque when newer bettors try and understand the corresponding probabilities associated with each bet. We can work in terms of &amp;ldquo;Implied Odds&amp;rdquo;, which are simply the corresponding percentage chance that you would need to win for the bet to be breakeven in expected value. A +200 Moneyline has corresponding Implied Odds of 33.3%. Abroad, odds are frequently reported in fractional terms, a +200 Moneyline corresponds to 2/1 (&amp;ldquo;two to one&amp;rdquo;) odds. We note that Moneyline odds will be in the form of plus or minus at least \(100\). American sports will also report bettling lines such as the New England Patriots being \(-7.5\) for their game. This is a &lt;em&gt;point spread&lt;/em&gt;, where there is even money to be made betting whether the Patriots will score at least \(7.5\) more points than their opponent. I personally find it nearly impossible to quickly understand Moneyline odds in terms of probabilities, so I built a light 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/odds-converter/klechkhopfnjihobbcfeheooaigjjgdg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; that can quickly perform these conversions on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;parlays&#34;&gt;Parlays&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard bets offer a payout based on a binary result. You might bet that the Golden State Warriors win the NBA title (&amp;ldquo;NBA Futures&amp;rdquo;), or that the Eagles score at least six more points than the Raiders in their upcoming game (&amp;ldquo;beating the spread&amp;rdquo;). A bettor who has fallen on hard times might have little to do for the whole weekend but watch sports, and could place separate bets that Alabama beats Oklahoma and that Clemson beats Notre Dame in the College Football Playoff. However, they could also &amp;ldquo;parlay&amp;rdquo; events, in which they &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; get paid out if &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; those events occur (if Clemson beats ND but Alabama loses, then they would receive nothing). This seems like a scam, but the allure is that under a parlay the payoffs are multiplicative, and much more lucrative than simply the sum of those individual payouts. This is alluring to many bettors because it promises large paydays. In the above example, Alabama and Clemson were both large favorites, at -555 and -440 respectively (i.e. you have to place a bet of \$555 or \$440 to win a prize of \$100 if you are correct). Parlays are appealing to bettors because we have poor intuition for the likelihood of a number of independent (explained below) very likely events &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; occurring. This fallacy is ubiquitous. In college football, when halfway through the season, a dozen contenders are 6-0, analysts and fans tend to look at their upcoming schedule, see that they are favored in each of those six games, and tend to muse about the situation in which each of those individually likely events occurs. In politics, readers are perplexed when analysts predict that of some 100 house races that lean solidly to one side, there will very likely be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; number of shocking upsets, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t know which one. Our mind works by considering individual events. If I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; remaining football game your team is likely to lose, you may be accustomed to think that the most likely result is that you don&amp;rsquo;t lose a single one, even when that is an unlikely event (as shown by the fact that even the top contenders tend to lose a game by the end of the college football season).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, parlays are appealing to bookies because they encourage more betting, and bookies profit from the volume of bets placed. There is no &lt;em&gt;catch&lt;/em&gt; here, and the bookies give a fair price on a parlay. Instead of the Clemson &amp;amp; Alabama example, we consider one where the probabilities are intuitive, with an extremely boring bookie that allows you to bet on the results of die rolls with no rake (which is the tax they take as profit on any bet placed). In each case, you bet \$1. For Bet A, they toss two dice, and you win \$12 (including your bet) when they sum to at least 11. For Bet B, they toss a single die, and you win \$6 (including your bet) if they roll a six. Both these bets have an expected value of 0. For Bet A, this has a 1 in 12 chance of occuring, so if you have placed a \$1 bet, you have a 1 in 12 chance of winning \$12, which is fair (and the same for Bet B with a 1 in 6 chance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to up the stakes and instead ask for a parlay on these events, you could significantly increase your possible payout. Bookies are perfectly fair when it comes to parlays. They set their own lines, and choose how much &amp;ldquo;rake&amp;rdquo; to take from the bets, but when it comes to parlays, bookies follow a simple formula which preserves the expected value of the payouts. They simply consider it the same as a single bet on the event where both happen, with that probability computed by multiplying the individual probabilities together. In the case above, a parlay of Bet A and Bet B would yield a whopping \$72 payout when it hits. This calculation is predicated on the idea that the probability that both A and B occur is the product of their individual probabilities, so \(1/6 * 1/12 = 1/72\). If we use the mathematical shorthand \(P(A)\) to denote &amp;ldquo;Probability of Bet A succeeding&amp;rdquo;, and \(P(A,B)\) for &amp;ldquo;probability of both Bet A and Bet B succeeding&amp;rdquo;, we write this as \(P(A)*P(B)=P(A,B)\). Those familiar with probability will note that this formula holds for any two events which are &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt;, that is, where information about the result of one event tells us nothing about the result of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independence is a mathematically defined concept, but we have an intuition for its meaning. If I ask you to guess the probability that a baby is born on a white Christmas (that is, on a December 25th where it snows), you would be foolish to take the probability that the baby is born on December 25th, and multiply it by the probability that it is snowing on any given day. It is significantly more likely that it snows on December 25th than the average day because it is in the middle of winter. The proper calculation would be to find the product of the probabilities that it is December 25th, and that it is snowing on any given December 25th (a conditional probability, whose  definition we sidestep here). Luckily, in the case of our dice rolling bookie, independence is pretty irrefutable. Assuming that the dice are fair and properly weighted, the results of the first pair of rolls have no effect on the outcome of some later rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;parlays-of-dependent-events&#34;&gt;Parlays of Dependent Events&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prompts the question, how do parlays work when the events are not independent? The short answer is that bookies generally do not offer parlays on dependent events, and that parlaying events that are positively correlated (i.e. the chance of one occurring makes it more likely that the other occurs) is profitable for the bettor. Luckily, most bets offered by the bookie tend to be independent. The scores of football games on a given Sunday seem to have little relation to one another. The most common bets to show dependence in fact show a &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; correlation, when only one can occur. A parlay on NBA futures where both the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers win the NBA title is clearly nonsensical (the fact that the probability of both occurring is 0 is a form of dependence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if a bookie allows betting on positively correlated events? This is best demonstrated by example. We consider Bet A and Bet B again, but with a twist. Bet A remains the same, but now define Bet B to be whether the first die rolled &lt;em&gt;of those used for Bet A&lt;/em&gt; is a six (rather than rolling a new die. Clearly, the individual probabilities are the same. However, these events are no longer independent. Intuitively, the success of Bet B (so the first roll is a 6) greatly increases the chance that Bet A succeeds (although it does not guarantee it). More precisely, the probability that both Bet A and Bet B occur is simply 1/18, as there are two possible rolls that are valid ([6,5] and [6,6]). However, \(1/18 &amp;gt; 1/72 = 1/6*1/12\). Thus, if the bookie provided an \$18 payout on this parlay, it would be break even for the bettor. If they provided the $72 pay out prescribed by the standard parlay formula, a bettor would print money in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlated events still have a &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; and fair price (in the example above, it was the substantially reduced price of $18). However, this computation required knowledge of their exact correlation. This is straightforward when it comes to the rolling of two dice, but difficult when it comes to the complex real world bets that bookies profit from. We can intuitively guess that the Super Bowl prop bet &amp;ldquo;Tom Brady throws for two or more touchdowns&amp;rdquo; is likely correlated with the bet &amp;ldquo;The Patriots (his team) win the Super Bowl&amp;rdquo;. In the world where we know Brady had a prolific scoring night, his team&amp;rsquo;s chances of winning are much higher (having essentially &amp;ldquo;removed&amp;rdquo; all of the worlds in which the Patriots offense was shut out, many of which were losing scenarios). But it is very difficult to estimate precisely how correlated those events are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookies prefer the simple solution: they do not offer correlated parlays. You can bet separately on these events, but they offer a singular pricing formula for parlays. Either the events are independent (in which case the probabilities are multicative, and they use their standard pricing formula), or they do not offer the parlay. In the world of sports, the divide between dependence and independence is usually fairly clear. Events in separate games on the same day should be independent. Events &lt;em&gt;within the same game&lt;/em&gt; tend not to be. There are correlations between a wide variety of events within the same game, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t as obvious as &amp;ldquo;touchdowns scored&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;final result&amp;rdquo;. If a basketball team has twin stars, there will tend to be a slight negative correlation between their points scored, because there are a limited number of possessions and each shot taken by one player is a shot the other does not take. There are of course mitigating factors: a high scoring night for one player might indicate that the opposing defense is poor, or the two stars might both pass less to their supporting cast on nights when those role players are shooting poorly. But neither effect tends to outweigh the simple fact that there are a limited number of shots in the game. Bookies feel no obligation to attempt to set the correct price on these myriad combinations, and instead allow for parlays solely in the case of obviously plausible independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;parlays-in-political-elections&#34;&gt;Parlays in Political Elections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the statement &amp;ldquo;bookies do not allow for correlated parlays&amp;rdquo; is a sweeping generalization. Bookies make mistakes, and the &amp;ldquo;rake&amp;rdquo; that they take allows for a reasonable margin of error. It is better practice for them to consistently offer bets that attract bettors, than worry about the singular case in which they make a small mistake and suffer a loss. Bookies limit the amount that can be wagered at any given time, so even when they set an inaccurate line, they are not fleeced by sharp gamblers with deep pockets. It is always worth keeping an eye out for situations where bookies might slip up and offer such a profitable parlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such example came in the form of the 2018 midterm elections. Bookies offered bets on the results of individual races, general trends (&amp;ldquo;How many seats do Republicans gain in the Senate?&amp;quot;), and more. Some correlations are powerful and obvious. The result that Josh Hawley (Missouri), Dean Heller (Nevada), and Mike Braun (Indiana) win their Senate races is highly correlated with the GOP retaining control of the Senate. If they win those three close races, the odds that they somehow lose enough much more safe Senate seats for the Democrats to flip control is next to 0. I did not see any bookie foolish enough to allow parlays on these events. Generally, bookies are acutely aware that vertical structures like this (where one result is an aggregate of many individual results) have clear positive correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there was at least one bookie that allowed for parlays of &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; Senate races. For bookies accustomed to sports, this might seem sensible, as it is superficially similar to parlaying simultaneous game results. However, separate senate races can show obvious and consistent correlation. Some may dislike the language of this claim, as philisophically, it depends on your probabilistic interpretatin of a political race. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to see the connection between the senate choice of individual voters in Arizona and Nevada. However, under that framework, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how random chance enters the equation at all (voters are not flipping a coin at the ballot box, by and large). This ties into a deeper issue of how we interpret probabilistic forecasts, but my short answer would be that we use probability describe level of uncertainty about complex phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polling is the base staple of an election prediction. Even in the fantastical world where polls represent a perfectly random sampling of the entire voting population, there is the uncertainty that stems from the inherent randomness of such a random sample (luckily, this form of uncertainty is easy to mathematically model, and disappears as our sample gets very large). Then there is the uncertainty comes from the practical realities of imperfect polling, which crudely violates the simple assumptions taught in an introductory probability class (consider the work 538 does to grade pollsters as part of this uncertainty). And the final nebulous level of uncertainty comes from translating the results of the poll (which studies on a specific date who people say they plan to vote for) to the results of the election itself (determined by the choice of people who actually place a vote). These are two separate questions, and even if a poll precisely answers its own question, the translation of that to answer the second question can be clouded by the uncertainty of news that breaks after the poll is conducted, or voters who think it over some more and get cold feet, or a storm which prevents those without a car from making their way to the polling station, or any number of ways that these questions can differ. Election models have to grapple with these layers of uncertainty, and as a result a site like 538 reports that Ted Cruz has a &amp;ldquo;7 in 9&amp;rdquo; chance to beat Beto O&amp;rsquo;Rourke, and not complete certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim that election results are correlated fits neatly into this framework. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to define the connection between the individual decisions of voters in two states about two different pairs of candidates. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how the errors in the probabilitic forecast would be connected. This is particularly true in the heavily partisan landscape of our current political system. The senate races in Nevada and Arizona aren&amp;rsquo;t entirely separate. In each of these demographically similar states, the populace is choosing between a democrat and a republican. Thus, certain forecasting errors made in one state tend to be mirrored in the other. The mistakes that pollsers make which could underestimate latino turnout will cause a similar divergence from the election forecasts and the final result in the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that even in a world where the election outcomes are random according to the exact probabilities prescribed by the betting markets, a parlay offers a chance for profit. The positive correlation of these two results simply needs to outweigh the cost of the rake on these bets for these bets to have a positive expected value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can illustrate this with the example of the bets I placed on the 2018 midterms. A significantly more complex and involved strategy could be used to profit from this parlaying opportunity, but this was just a fun example of the concept in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winning a Debate: Insights from &#34;Intelligence Squared&#34;</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;How does one measure the winner of a debate? If the debate itself is the focus, it’s wholly unsatisfying to just tally up the opinions of the viewers, as that solely reflects the prior beliefs of the audience. “Intelligence Squared” is an excellent podcast which teaches policy through moderated debate. A resolution is proposed (e.g. “Affirmative Action does more harm than good”), and two teams of two experts argue the issue in a structured setting. Many other programs aim for balance with a halfhearted attempt to pay lip service to the opposing side (without truly believing it), so it’s refreshing to hear passionate and informed argument from both sides of the aisle. If one side cites a misleading statistic, their opponents are ready to actually call them out on it, penalizing the lazy rhetorical tactics that plague discourse in an echo chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of the program is the debate itself, but some nominal winner must still be declared. This is determined using a simple formula. The audience is polled before and after the debate (For, Against, or Undecided on the issue), and the side which gains the most votes is the winner. To be clear, I do not think that this method of declaring a winner is a particularly important to the show, nor do I think any listeners actually consider the swings of audience opinion to be the final say on the matter. But it’s still interesting to consider whether or not this is a reasonable way to declare a debate winner. And more broadly, what can the results of a debate tell us about the way that people make up their minds on polarizing issues? Much has been written about the politically charged climate of the present, and the ways in which the media we consume is entrenching us in our positions, leading to static and polarized political views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Intelligence Squared doesn’t just measure the change in support for each side before and after the debate, for events since 2012 it also measured the individual shifts between each category (i.e. “Undecided before and For after”, or “For before and Against after”). This provides a small but insightful dataset looking at the ways in which minds can change on a polarizing issue in the course of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-to-win-a-debate&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What does it mean to “win” a debate?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence Squared declares their nominal winner with a simple metric, measuring whether the For or Against side had the largest absolute percentage point shift in support from the pre debate to the post debate audience poll. Thus, if the For side originally had 40% support and the Against side 35% support before the debate, and after the debate the For side had 45% support and the Against side had 43% support, the 8 percentage point increase of the Against side trumps the 5 percentage point increase of the For side, and the Against side wins the night. We will refer to this method for determining a victory as the ISM (Intelligence Squared Metric).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this approach stems from the fact that &lt;em&gt;there are a variety of ways that opinions could shift between the three camps&lt;/em&gt;. This is related to both its usage of absolute percentage point change (with no reference to the relative switch), as well as the presence of the undecided voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/94742&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; excellent post by &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; on StackExchange. I have the pleasure of knowing &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; in person, and in characteristic fashion he gives a thorough and insightful analysis of the ways in which we can have different shifts in support (among the different groups) for the same absolute result, in ways that make determining the winner quite difficult. We cite a simple example proposed by &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a situation where originally 20% are For, 60% are Against, and 20% are undecided (we will write this as a vector &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((.2, .6, .2)\)&lt;/span&gt;). After the debate, the vector of support is &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\((.3, .4, .3)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Under the ISM, this is a clear and decisive win for the For side, as they gained 10 percentage points of support, while the Against side lost 20 percentage points. However, there are a variety of between-group opinion switches that could lead to this result. &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; suggests that we write these between-group switches in a 3x3 transition matrix, where the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(ij\)&lt;/span&gt;th element represents the percent of the original supporters for the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;th camp before the debate are supporters of the &lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(j\)&lt;/span&gt;th camp after the debate (with For as 1, Against as 2, and Undecided as 3). Then, this represents a plausible transition matrix for our final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\mathbb{A} = \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 0.32 &amp;amp; 0.29 &amp;amp; 0.32 \\
 0.36 &amp;amp; 0.42 &amp;amp; 0.36 \\
 0.32 &amp;amp; 0.29 &amp;amp; 0.32 \\
\end{array}
\right).
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt; explains,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, 36% of the “Fors” changed to the other side while only 29% of the “Against” changed to the opposite opinion. Moreover, slightly more of the undecideds (36%) vs 32%) came out “against” rather than for. Although their numbers in this audience decreased, we have a situation (reminiscent of Simpson’s Paradox) in which the “Against” faction clearly won the debate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a possible outcome where Intelligence Squared would declare the “For” side a decisive winner, but in terms of percentage shifts, the “Against” side was more persuasive at both convincing Undecideds to join their side, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; convincing those with a prior opinion to change their viewpoint. This clarifies the challenge inherent in determining the winner of a debate. When one side is initially quite unpopular, they have a larger population of possible voters that they can woo, which makes their proportional gains much higher in absolute terms. There’s certainly a plausible argument that absolute shifts in support should be the most important factor in determining a winner, but this does make the situation more complex. And it gets even messier in cases where the sub-group switches don’t necessarily agree. We might see one side sway a much larger proportion of the Undecided voters, while being less successful at convincing those from the other side to switch. This could leave us without a conclusive winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-has-this-worked-in-practice&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How has this worked in practice?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the results of the Intelligence Squared debates in reality, we see that the majority of results are uncontroversial. and there is little doubt which side was more convincing. In total, we gather the results from 88 debates from the Intelligence Squared &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, with the process described &lt;a href=&#34;https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/debateresults2/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the unpolished scraped dataset &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/IntelSquaredProject/blob/master/votingresultsfinal.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first winning metric we consider is the Intelligence Squared Metric (ISM), which measures shift in absolute percentage of support. We next consider the Undisputed Metric (UDM), which uses the proportional switching outlined above, and only assigns a winner when one side &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; convinces a greater proportion of Undecided voters to join their side, as well as a greater proportion of the other side to switch their opinion. In cases when these do not agree, no winner is declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the first question is whether there are cases where the UDM declares a winner which is the reverse of the ISM, like the toy example outlined above by &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an idle concern, and in fact there have been six debates with this conflicting result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not surprising when the absolute percentage changes are so close (such as in “Cutting the Pentagon’s budget…”), but the other debates show some wildly divergent results. We even see an example of &lt;em&gt;whuber&lt;/em&gt;’s hypothesized situation. In the “Trigger Warnings” debate on 06/23/2018, we see the For camp lose support, the Against camp gain support, and yet we see that the For camp was declared the winner by the UDM. The transition matrix for this debate is shown here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\text{Trigger Warnings Debate: }\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
0.67 &amp;amp; 0.44 &amp;amp; 0.39 \\ 
0.26 &amp;amp; 0.56 &amp;amp; 0.33 \\ 
0.07 &amp;amp; 0.00 &amp;amp; 0.28 \\ 
\end{array}
\right).
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The For camp was able to lure 39% of the Undecided voters, compared to only 33% by the Against camp. And the For side was able to convince 44% of the Against camp to change their minds, while the Against camp convinced only 26% of the For camp to swap. And yet the For camp &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; support, while the Against camp gained support. This can easily be explained by the initial disparity in popularity. The For side began with 57% of the vote, so while they convinced a larger proportion of Undecided and Against voters to change their view, they had a minority of the audience who were even available to sway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of the issue, because it feels fundamentally wrong to declare the winner of the debate to be a side that &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; popularity during the course of the night. This cousin of Simpson’s Paradox defies our intuition, where we want relative and absolute changes to point in the same direction. I think there’s an argument for both sides. The issue with using the UDM (with subgroup proportional shifts) is that there’s an inherent expectation that a debate will shift opinions towards the center. If one group starts overwhelmingly popular, and both sides sway the proportional amount of people to their side, then that side will tend to lose share. It doesn’t make much sense that we would expect any evenly matched debate to bring public opinion towards a 50/50 split, but a series of dead even debates (as measured by the UDM) would push the audience towards that equilibrium point. And yet, we think of the goal of debates as being one of persuasion. And so it makes little sense to declare one side the winner because they had a larger possible audience to persuade, even if their marginal rate of persuasion was inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;are-there-obvious-issues-in-the-original-metric&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are there obvious issues in the original metric?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no singular way to measure the efficacy of these metrics, and it ultimately comes down to our subjective intuition about what it means to “win” a debate. However, we can reasonably agree on some criteria that we intuitively find “fair”. Generally, we want a debate to be a plausibly even playing field from the start. An even more intuitive metric would simply be the popularity of each motion after the debate (which we refer to as the Final Popularity Metric [FPM]), but we reject this approach because it so obviously favors the side that is initially popular with the audience. It’s then worth it to consider whether the ISM is biased in ways that clash with our intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious plausible bias is that of the initial popularity of each position. In fact, this is why we do not simply use the FPM , so it is perhaps instructive to consider what such bias looks like. We plot the initial popularity of the For and Against positions below, and use color to denote the final winner by the FPM (i.e. which position was ultimately more popular with the audience). Exactly as we’d expect, there is a heavy bias to the initial starting positions. There are a few instances where a particularly large swing allows for the initially unfavorable position to pull out a win, but generally the winner is determined simply by initial popularity, and the processs of the debate itself is largely irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_FPresults.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![OriginalResults]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_FPresults.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we consider the same plot colored by the standard ISM results, we see a much more promising picture. On first glance, this adjustment does a plausible job of removing the bias from initial popularity. We theorized that the ISM might be punishing to sides that begin with overwhelming popularity, becuase they have so many fewer people that they can convert to their side (and an increase from 90 to 95 percent popularity might only be 5 percentage points, but represents a massive 50% decrease in those who don’t support that side). However, in practice, most positions start at a popularity between 20% and 50%, so those extreme examples just aren’t as concerning. And within that range, the naked eye doesn’t detect any overwhelming patterns of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_winnerorigresults.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![OriginalResults]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_winnerorigresults.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One plausible trend that might stand out lies in the bottom right of the chart, where we do note that debates with an initially extremely high For share tended to be won by the Against side. Of the seven debates where the For side began with at least 60% vote share, the Against side won six contests and For won only one. This is a very small sample, but it does fit our intuition, and thus the lack of bias might simply stem from the fact that it is only observed in the extreme starting positions, which occur rarely. We do note that the reverse extreme (where the Against side has initally dominant popularity) does not show any such obvious trend, which makes this slightly less troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prior plot only considers the binary outcome under the ISM, but we are not solely concerned with the effect on the binary result, but rather the effect on percentage point change, which can manifest in a shift of binary result. Thus, it must be more illsutrative to break down the effect further. We create 4 bins of debates based on a partition of the initial popularity of the For camp. For each bin, we consider a box plot of the percentage change that the debate creates for the For camp along with the percentage change for the Against camp, which provides a more precise analysis. As before, the picture is muddled until we consider the final bin (debates where the For side enjoyed a 55% or more share of the support), where almost all of the changes to the For side were lesser than the changes for the Against side. This is a much more persuasively troubling result than the simple results observed above, but the sample remains small (only 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_partitionvotechange.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![PartitionVoteShare]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_partitionvotechange.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe a peculiar result, but are unsure whether it could simply result from random chance. This question of statistical significance is at the heart of the study of statistics. However, it is not immediately clear to me which tool is suited to the situation. A simple comparison of the mean changes of these different bins seems deeply problematic. It is unclear that we can make any plausible assumptions about the distribution of the changes of votes. Crucially, the changes to the For vote share are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; independent to the changes to the Against vote share. And there is a clear confounding variable, where change to For vote share is going to be effected not simply by initial For vote, but by the initial number of undecideds (we certainly have not proven this, but common sense says that an undecided voter is easier to persuade than one who believes in the opposing viewpoint). More broadly, any such test from here is problematic in the way that Exploratory Data Analysis tends to be. We have not rigorously predefined our research question based on a scientific hypothesis, we are simply confirming our vague intuition that starting vote share introduces bias. Thus, a test based on this particular binning creates some form of bias. If we explored deep enough into the data, eventualy we must have found something similarly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use a nonparametric test to examine the implausibility of the observed trend, but we must keep the bias mentioned above closely in mind. Exploratory data analysis minimizes this problem by relying on standardized statistical tests which answer broad questions. A nonparametric test that examines the statistical implausibility of the difference observed in the arbitrary binning we have chosen above is far less robust. An example statistical test is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test&#34;&gt;Kruskal-Wallis Rank test&lt;/a&gt;. This nonparametric test simply considers the ranked values of the observed data, and considers the statistical probability that we might observe such an extreme disparity as what occurs in our sample. This provides a statistically rigorous result without reliance on assumptions, but the issue is that it provides such an answer to a deeply narrow &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt;. In our case, we could consider the Kruskal-Wallis test with the changes to the For vote for two groups: those with initial share of 55+%, and those with lesser initial share. In this case, we observe a test statistic of 8.1929, and a p-value of 0.42%. Phrased in statistical language, this means that if our two groups generated changes to the For vote share with the same distribution, there would be less than a one in two hundred chance that we observe at least as large a disaparity in the ranks of the observed values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the question this answers is deceptively narrow. It cannot make any bold claims about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; debates that begin with 55+% vote share or fewer, but only the ones which we observe. If we had an ideal sample of such debates, and considered those above and below this threshold, then such a statement would be extremely powerful. Instead, our initial sample size of 11 debates means it is quite plausible that there are other fundamental differences in these samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrates the statistical significance in the difference of the distribution of these samples, but makes no claim as to why. And we have little conclusive proof that it is the prior vote share of the For side that creates this disparity, it could be any number of differences between the populations that provides the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--
We can stick to a nonparametric test to sidestep of our lack of reasonable assumptions, but we must keep the above concerns closely in mind during this work. This will provide a useful benchmark for the improbability of the observed result, but there will be subjective choices made in the construction of our test (as there is no singular way to formulate our hypothesis). We must simply make reasonable choices, and keep this issue in mind (an issue at the heart of any statistical test conducted after exploratory data analysis, albeit one that is significantly less concerning when the test being used is cookie cutter and not subjectively defined by the examiner). Such 
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an obviously unsatisfying result, but in the name of intellectual honesty I hesitate to any bolder claim. Qualitatively, I do think that the sum of this analysis makes it very likely that our intuition that those with an initially high For vote share experience notable disadvantage for winning the debate under the metric used by Intelligence Squared. However, these extreme cases come up very rarely, and the ISM seems quite defensible for the purposes of the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;alternative-metrics&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is of course interesting to consider other metrics that one could use. Outlined above, we consider the Undisputed Metric (UDM), which instead considers the percentage that switch between each camp during the debate. The UDM declares a winner if that side converts both a greater percentage of the other side to swap, as well a greater percentage of the Undecided camp to join theirs. In cases where there is disagreement (e.g. the For side convinces a greater proportion of Against voters to join their side than vice versa, but the Against side convinces a greater proportion of Undecided voters), the UDM simply declares that there is no clear winner. The UDM operates under a fundamentally different mindset: that what matters is not the percentage point change, but the proportion of voters who you sway. As noted above, it is perfectly possible for the UDM to declare the opposite winner to the ISM (this is particularly likely to happen in those cases where one side has initially extreme vote share). We first consider another plot of the debate result under the UDM compared to the initial For and Against vote shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![UDM Box Plot](IQ2_winnerUDMresults.png) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_winnerUDMresults.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ![]({{ &#34;/images/IQ2_winnerUDMresults.png&#34;}}) --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the ISM, under the UDM it seems the initial popularities are overly determinative of the final result. But we do observe something of a reverse trend: if an initial side has at least 50% share of the starting vote, now they nearly always win. We again break down this effect by considering the voting shifts for debates binned by their initial For vote share. Now, our object of interest is not simply the percentage point change, but a variety of changes (in this plot, we consider the proportion of initially Against voters who shift to For, Undecided persuaded to join the For camp, and initially For voters who defect to the against side). Note that the coloring is done using our initial For popularity partition, unlike above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;IQ2_UDMboxplots.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reflects the effects expected from our initial results. Initially high For popularity tends to imply that they will persuade a higher proportion of Against voters, and that a lower proportion of For voters will defect to Against, while the results for Undecided voters are decidedly muddled. This is what we would expect. A high initial For vote share implies a lower Against vote share, so converting a small number of Against voters shows a lower percentage point change, but a large proportional change. The movement of undecided voters does not follow this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of which side is the winner in a debate is far from straightforward. Our intuition tells us that it should depend on the performance of the debaters, and not simply reflect the initial position of the audience. This is why we do not conduct a simple exit poll on the popularity of each side, which the data shows is massively biased towards the initial popularity of the sides. Unsurprisingly, audience members have extremely strong priors on these hotly contested issues, and an hour of debate does not ovewhelm a lifetime of thought on the matter. Intelligence Squared adjusts for this bias by polling the audience before the debate, and considering the percentage point change that each side observe. We hypothesize that this may instead be biased to disfavor initially popular sides. This appears to occur in the observed data, but extreme initial popularity is relatively rare, so it is hard to precisely prove the magnitude of this effect. In fact, the data shows that this metric seems to be a reasonably fair benchmark in practice. We outline one alternative for determining the winner, which is to consider the proportional changes among each sides. Counterintuitively, it is perfectly possible for one side in a debate to lose under the Intelligence Squared system, and yet persuade a greater proportion of both Undecideds and the other side to defect. In fact, we observe this scenario in a number of debates that occur. In practice, following this metric appears to bias results in the opposite manner, where initially popular sides are again favored (although in a similarly plausibly fair way in all but extreme cases). It is worth keeping in mind that the metric used by Intelligence Squared is but one reasonable choice, and while it serves their purposes well, it should not be considered the ultimate determination of efficacy in debate. Luckily, no one would doubt that the experience of the debate is what matters, and the mark of a winner is simply a superficial afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Scraping the &#34;Intelligence Squared&#34; Debate Results</title>
      <link>/post/scraping-is2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/scraping-is2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a brief companion to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/debatefinalsummary/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; analyzing the methods of assigning a winner to a debate, using the Intelligence Squared dataset. I will briefly outline here how I assemble that dataset, for trasparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;compiling-the-pages&#34;&gt;Compiling the Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results from each Intelligence Squared debate are posted online in pages such as 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/globalization-has-undermined-americas-working-class&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, including video of the debate, a description of the major positions of each side, the qualifications of the debaters, and most importantly, the results of the audience polling. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a central hub page that neatly lists all the URLs. However, the desired dataset isn’t huge (about 90 total debates), so there’s no substitute for the occasional work simply manually trawling through the website, and recording the date, name, and URL of each debate in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scraping-the-numbers&#34;&gt;Scraping the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have a full list of all the relevant URLs, luckily, the results themselves are generally presented in a consistent format. Thus,  some simple work with regular expressions gathers the data that we need. One such example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;debate_vote_results={&amp;quot;live&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;pre&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:36,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:45,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:19,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;post&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:32,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:61,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:7,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;s&amp;quot;:41,&amp;quot;t&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:18,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:15,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:3},&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:38,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:1},&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:8,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:8,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:3}},&amp;quot;online&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;t&amp;quot;:100,&amp;quot;pre&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:50,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:35,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:15,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;post&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:44,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:50,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:35,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:13,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:2},&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:4,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:27,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:4},&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;f&amp;quot;:6,&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;u&amp;quot;:0}}};
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case anyone wants to borrow this sort of simple scrape for their own projects, you can find the code 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/IntelSquaredProject/blob/master/intelsquareddata.R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, although the approach is extremely messy. Luckily, with R it’s more important to be fast than it is to be clean, and you can use very awkward code as long as you find it readable and clear. Regular expressions like this can grab the relevant numbers that we need, and we store it in one large data frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-R&#34;&gt;gsub(&amp;quot;.*\&amp;quot;f\&amp;quot;:\\{\&amp;quot;f\&amp;quot;:(\\d+\\.*\\d*),\&amp;quot;a\&amp;quot;:(\\d+\\.*\\d*),\&amp;quot;u\&amp;quot;:(\\d+\\.*\\d*).*&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;\\1 \\2 \\3&amp;quot;, post)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where we identify the numbers that we’re interested in. With the numbers compiled into one large data frame (which can be viewed in raw form 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/IntelSquaredProject/blob/master/votingresultsfinal.csv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for those interested in examining the data themselves). In total, there are 88 debates stretching back to 2012 which have all the information needed. The program itself stretches back further, but they only began tracking the subgroup movements more recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we can actually dive into the data itself.&lt;/p&gt;

I knew a few people who wanted to try the extension, so I thought it’d be a fun exercise to go through the process of uploading it to the Chrome store. You can view and add the extension to your own browser 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/odds-converter/klechkhopfnjihobbcfeheooaigjjgdg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This is far from a polished state, given that it was meant to be a quick way to explore something new. However, I do find myself using the finished product a surprising amount, so I thought it was worth keeping on the Webstore. And it’s nice to see how easy Google makes it to upload a simple app.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-a-new-page&#34;&gt;Opening a New Page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our simple extension from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dylanpotteroconnell.github.io/bettingextension/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; works quite well to replace text on a page, but whenever text isn&amp;rsquo;t displayed in a nice format (which is true for many mdoern websites), it won&amp;rsquo;t do much good. The hope is to add functionality to it so that the user can easily and manually input the odds that they need. My vision was to let the user right click, and open up a page that lets them impute the odds to convert in a more detailed format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before, I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about Javascript to start from scratch, so I borrow and adapt from some others online. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4376167/text-selection-and-display-in-context-menu-chrome-extension&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt; provides an example of creating a context menu upon a user right click that is the right structure. Importantly, this also provides a framework for storing any selected text that the user right clicks. The end goal is to let them auto populate our odds converter page, so we leave in that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;\\ rightClick.js
var selection_callbacks = [];
function getSelection(callback) {
 selection_callbacks.push(callback);
    chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, { file:&amp;quot;selection.js&amp;quot; });
  };
  chrome.extension.onRequest.addListener(function (request) {
    var callback = selection_callbacks.shift();
    callback(request);
  });

function openConverter(selectedText) {
  var serviceCall = &#39;converter.html&#39;
  chrome.tabs.create({ url: serviceCall });
}
var tx = getSelection();
var title = &amp;quot;Convert: &#39;&amp;quot; + tx + &amp;quot;&#39; title&amp;quot;;
var id = chrome.contextMenus.create({
    title: &amp;quot;Convert Odds?&amp;quot;,
    contexts:[&amp;quot;selection&amp;quot;],
    onclick: function(info, tab) {
        openConverter(info.selectionText);
    }
});
console.log(&amp;quot;selection item:&amp;quot; + id);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;\\ selection.js
chrome.extension.sendResponse(convert(window.getSelection().toString()));
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty rote, with small changes from the linked work (and final code 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/oddsextension/blob/master/replaceScript.js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Initially, I hoped to perform some calculations with the selected text, and then display the result in the context menu itself. After some trial and error, it seems that this is quite a bit more complicated than it would seem. While you can reference the text in the selection using &amp;ldquo;%s&amp;rdquo;, the issue is that this is passed through our function as the literal string &amp;ldquo;%s&amp;rdquo;, and not the selection itself, until it is displayed (at which point it is replaced by tthe selection). This means we can&amp;rsquo;t easily perform a calculation with it. The underlying challenge is that Chrome wants to display the text on the context menu immediately, so we would need to manually program in a structure that lets it wait for us to convert the text. For now, we instead focusing on simply opening the useful HTML page &amp;ldquo;oddsconverter.html&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;odds-converter-html-page&#34;&gt;Odds Converter HTML Page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want an HTML page that neatly converts between each sort of odds. For a rough idea of the base template, we borrow 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.daniweb.com/programming/web-development/threads/468068/auto-calculate-two-textfields&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; guide. While their goal is quite unrelated, this form has the neat feature where it calculates its result after &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; keystroke. I want this extension to be light and nimble, so I like the idea of it constantly updating based on new input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- https://www.daniweb.com/programming/web-development/threads/468068/auto-calculate-two-textfields --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;converter.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;form name=&amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; action=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;convert&amp;quot; &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span id=&amp;quot;update&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Odds Converter&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot; onkeyup=&amp;quot;convML(this)&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Money Line &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;frac&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;frac&amp;quot; onkeyup=&amp;quot;convFrac(this)&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Fractional Odds &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;ip&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;ip&amp;quot; onkeyup=&amp;quot;convIP(this)&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Implied Probability &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;total&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;total&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy lifting is of course done by the functions stored in the javascript file &amp;ldquo;converter.js&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;function convML(obj) {
  if(/^[\+|-] ?[0-9]+$/.test(obj.value)){
    var pattern = /([+|-]) ?([0-9]+)/;
    var newIP = obj.value.replace(pattern,
      function(fm,$1,$2)
      {
        if ($1==&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;)
        {
          return(Math.round(100.0/(100.0+parseInt($2))*1000)/10.0)
        } else
        {
          return(Math.round(parseInt($2)/(100.0+parseInt($2))*1000)/10.0)
        }
      });
     var newFrac = String(Math.round(100/(newIP/100.0)-100)/100)+&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;;
     document.getElementById(&#39;ip&#39;).value = newIP;
     document.getElementById(&#39;frac&#39;).value = newFrac;
  }
}

function convFrac(obj) {
  document.getElementById(&#39;ip&#39;).value = obj.value;
// Add decimals

  if(/^[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*\/[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$/.test(obj.value)){
    var pattern = /([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)\/([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)/;
    var newIP  = obj.value.replace(pattern,
                                          function(fm,$1,$2)
                                          {
                                             return(Math.round(1000*parseFloat($2)/(parseFloat($2)+parseFloat($1)))/10.0)
                                          }
                                    );
     document.getElementById(&#39;ip&#39;).value = newIP;
     document.getElementById(&#39;ml&#39;).value = IPtoML(parseFloat(newIP)/100.0);
  }
}
  if(/^[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*$/.test(obj.value)){
    document.getElementById(&#39;ml&#39;).value = IPtoML(parseFloat(obj.value)/100.0);
  }
}

function IPtoML(IP) {
  if (IP &amp;gt; .5) {
    return(&amp;quot;-&amp;quot; + String(Math.round(100.0*IP/(1-IP))))
  } else if (IP &amp;lt;= .5) {
    return(&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;+String(Math.round(100.0/IP - 100)))
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the conversion functions follows the same format: after each keystroke in the text box, check if the given input is of the correct form, and if it is, upate the other two text boxes with the converted odds. The functionality is very limited, but it fulfills our purposes for now. Converting moneyline odds and implied probability to fractional odds is a tougher challenge, so for now we simiply display them as decimals with a denominator of one (while there is no straightforward one to one mapping to fractional odds, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to write an algorithm to make an educated guess as to what whole number odds are closest, but for now we keep it simple).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we open up this HTML page, it works as desired, but when we load it into our extension, it opens up and&amp;hellip; does nothing. None of the fields update themselves, no matter howm much you try. A quick Google search determines that we are barking right up the wrong tree. A few years ago, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy#JSExecution&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chrome banned all inline Javascript&lt;/a&gt; from its extension pages. I have no doubt that they had good security related reasons to do so, but it means that our page as written is quite useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;removing-inline-javascript&#34;&gt;Removing Inline Javascript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that for simple HTML forms like this, the switch is relatively painless. We remove the function calls from the HTML file, so &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot; onkeyup=&amp;quot;convML(this)&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Then, in our &amp;ldquo;converter.js&amp;rdquo; file, we need to add an EventListener function to process each of these events, based on their ID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;document.addEventListener(&amp;quot;DOMContentLoaded&amp;quot;, function(event) {
  document.getElementById(&amp;quot;ml&amp;quot;).addEventListener(&amp;quot;keyup&amp;quot;, function() {
        convML(document.getElementById(&#39;ml&#39;));
     });
  document.getElementById(&amp;quot;frac&amp;quot;).addEventListener(&amp;quot;keyup&amp;quot;, function() {
        convFrac(document.getElementById(&#39;frac&#39;));
     });
  document.getElementById(&amp;quot;ip&amp;quot;).addEventListener(&amp;quot;keyup&amp;quot;, function() {
        convIP(document.getElementById(&#39;ip&#39;));
     });
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of our code can stay the exact same. Once we use the EventListener format, our other Javascript functions work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OddsConverter Part 1: Converting Plaintext</title>
      <link>/post/oddsconverter-part1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/oddsconverter-part1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The same betting odds are often displayed in disparate ways, depending on the context. In America, normally in terms of a Moneyline, where +200 is shorthand for &amp;ldquo;if you bet $100, you can win an additional $200&amp;rdquo;. In other contexts, we generally see the tradition &amp;ldquo;X/Y&amp;rdquo; fractional odds. Both of these have clear mathematical meanings, but for inexperienced bettors, they tend to be poor conveyors of intuitive meaning. We can quickly estimate what &amp;ldquo;+350&amp;rdquo; implies, but for most people, it takes a mental calculation to do so. The most useful intuitive information about betting odds comes from the &amp;ldquo;Implied Probability&amp;rdquo;, which is the probability of the event necessary for you to &amp;ldquo;break even&amp;rdquo; on the bet. Betting sites don&amp;rsquo;t particularly like Implied Probability because it makes the cut they take more obvious (when mutually exclusive and complete events have probabilities that sum up to greater than one), and more intuitively accurate information for bettors can make them realize how daunting it is to actually keep up a positive expected value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone without the perfect intuition needed to convert these odds in my head, I got tired of glancing at a table of odds and trying to work out their precise value one by one. I thought it would be nice to have a very simple Google Chrome extension that could do it for me. The initial functionality is simple: click on the icon, and it converts any odds it can find on the page into Implied Probability. Click on it again, and it converts back. The challenge is that I have zero knowledge of JavaScript. Luckily, this task was simple enough that it could be cobbled together in the style of Frankenstein&amp;rsquo;s monster, with some slight modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;click-icon-replace-text&#34;&gt;Click Icon, Replace Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first feature necessary is simple an extension that runs a script when the icon is clicked. We find a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7168362/run-script-each-time-chrome-extension-icon-clicked&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow question&lt;/a&gt; (which will be the source of the code for most of the extension) with this very task. Every Chrome Extension begins with a manifest.json file, which gives an overview of the permissions and structure of the extension. I grab their initial suggested manifest.json, and make a number of modifications which will become necessary later. The &amp;ldquo;contextmenus&amp;rdquo; under permissions is only necessary to activate context menus within Chrome, which seems like a useful feature but is not yet crucial to the Extension&amp;rsquo;s functionality. I also made a set of three simple icons in GIMP, so that it looks natural in the browser. The key parts here are the two scripts under &amp;ldquo;background&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;rightclick.js&amp;rdquo; provides instructions for how to create a context menu upon right click, which we ignore for now (I played with it, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress). However, &amp;ldquo;background.js&amp;rdquo; is the script that tells our&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;
{
  &amp;quot;manifest_version&amp;quot;: 2,

  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Convert Odds into Implied Probability&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Click this icon to convert moneyline odds into implied probability, and vice versa.&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;version&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;background&amp;quot; : {
    &amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot; : [&amp;quot;background.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rightclick.js&amp;quot;]
  },
  &amp;quot;icons&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;16&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;icon16.png&amp;quot;,
             &amp;quot;48&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;icon48.png&amp;quot;,
             &amp;quot;128&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;icon128.png&amp;quot; },

  &amp;quot;browser_action&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;default_icon&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;icon48.png&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;default_title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Convert Odds&amp;quot;
  },
  &amp;quot;permissions&amp;quot;: [
    &amp;quot;activeTab&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;contextMenus&amp;quot;
  ]
}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key parts here are the two scripts under &amp;ldquo;background&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;rightclick.js&amp;rdquo; provides instructions for how to create a context menu upon right click, which we ignore for now (I played with it, but it&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress), and &amp;ldquo;background.js&amp;rdquo; is a script that calls our text replace script when the Extension icon is clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {
   chrome.tabs.executeScript(null, {file: &amp;quot;replaceScript.js&amp;quot;});
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;replaceScript.js&amp;rdquo; is the script that  runs a text replacement that converts anything that &amp;ldquo;looks like&amp;rdquo; odds into implied probabilities (and you can view the final script 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dylanpotteroconnell/oddsextension/blob/master/replaceScript.js&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Being totally unfamiliar with JavaScript, I grab code from an Extension that performs a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;simple text replace for each webpage&lt;/a&gt;. The base structure is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;var elements = document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;*&#39;);
for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; elements.length; i++) {
    var element = elements[i];
    for (var j = 0; j &amp;lt; element.childNodes.length; j++) {
        var node = element.childNodes[j];
        if (node.nodeType === 3) {
            var pattern = /abc/gi;
            var text = node.nodeValue;
            var replacedText = text.replace(pattern, &#39;def&#39;);
            if (replacedText !== text) {
                element.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(replacedText), node);
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;detect-patterns-calculate-conversions&#34;&gt;Detect Patterns, Calculate Conversions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we can use Regular Expressions to only replace certain structures of characters, rather than just one static string. To start, we want to try and identify sequences of exactly a plus or minus sign, followed by at least one digit (e.g. &amp;ldquo;-220&amp;rdquo;). The parentheses &amp;ldquo;capture&amp;rdquo; the characters inside, as we need to not just find these patterns, but extract the numbers. We want to find the end of the digits, but we want to leave the following character in the page&amp;rsquo;s HTML, so we &amp;ldquo;grab&amp;rdquo; the first nondigit character (the [^0-9), but only if it exists (the &amp;ldquo;?&amp;quot;) using &amp;ldquo;([^0-9]?)&amp;quot;, so that we can place that character after our converted expression, &lt;code&gt;var pattern = /([+|-])([0-9]+)([^0-9]?)/gi;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the challenge is that we want to perform a small calculation using the number provided. That means we need to be able to feed captured characters (preferably, the numbers and the +/- sign) as inputs into a function that determines the output of the replace function of text. I don&amp;rsquo;t know of the optimal way to do this in JavaScript, but with a Google search we find a way to do just that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bennadel.com/blog/55-using-methods-in-javascript-replace-method.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can replace the previous string used for our pattern with a lambda function. Note that the link provided is inaccurate in its description of the inputs to the lambda function, and this is corrected to the comments. The inputs to the dummy function here are always &amp;ldquo;the full match, $1, $2, $3, &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; (where $X refers to the xth capture element), while in the linked tutorial they use &amp;ldquo;$1$&amp;rdquo; in the function input to refer to the full text. We can adapt their function to convert an American moneyline into its implied odds as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34;&gt;
var replacedText = text.replace(pattern,
                                function(fm,$1,$2,$3)
				    {
				      if ($1==&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;)
				      {
					return(&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;+String(Math.round(100.0/(100.0+parseInt($2))*1000)/10.0)+&amp;quot;\%&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;+$3)
				      } else
				      {
					return(&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;+String(Math.round(parseInt($2)/(100.0+parseInt($2))*1000)/10.0)
						 +&amp;quot;\%&amp;quot;+&amp;quot;|&amp;quot;+$3)
				      }
				    });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth breaking this into parts. The inputs to our function are the full text (&amp;lsquo;fm&amp;rsquo;, which we do not use here, but I was not aware of how to suppress this input), and the three strings &amp;lsquo;captured&amp;rsquo; from our regex matching (where $1 refers to the +/- sign, $2 is the number of the line, and $3 is the trailing character). We compute the simple formula to go from a moneyline bet to its implied odds. For a moneyline of +$X, we earn $X+$100 on a win. Thus, the odds (O) needed to break even are $100=0*($X+$100), so O=$100/($X+$100). Similarly, for a moneyline of -$X, we bet $X to win $100, and the implied odds are O=$X/($X+$100). The final return statement is simply cobbled together from some JavaScript documentation. ParseInt turns the &amp;lsquo;$2&amp;rsquo; input into an integer, we then multiply by 1000, and divide by 10 to get the result in the form of a percentage with a single decimal place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We repeat this process with two other conversions: 2. Fractional Odds (i.e. &amp;ldquo;3/1&amp;rdquo;) to Implied Probability, and 3. &amp;ldquo;Undoing&amp;rdquo; our first conversion, converting implied probabilities back into moneyline odds. We do not include a separate &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; conversion for Fractional Odds, because I wanted to keep this extension very minimal, and detecting the most accurate Fractional Odds to a rounded decimal percentage is a less straightforward conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next&#34;&gt;Next&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in a simple but effective Chrome Extension that can save quite a bit of time. When on a page with odds in HTML text, you tap the button and can quickly see them replaced by their Implied Probabilities. The major downside is that more complex websites don&amp;rsquo;t always show their odds in such simple HTML text, and learning to detect them for the major bookmakers would be a more substantial challenge. However, most people encounter odds referenced in articles or text discussions, where this Extension works quite cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;data.csv&amp;quot;)
data.head()
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;data.csv&amp;quot;)
data.head()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;$...$&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$$...$$&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-tex&#34;&gt;$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ 
\left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T 
\left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}
{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left |\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right |^2}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;inline math&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})$&lt;/code&gt; renders as $\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;multi-line math&lt;/strong&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;\\\\&lt;/code&gt; math linebreak:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-tex&#34;&gt;$$f(k;p_0^*) = \begin{cases} p_0^* &amp;amp; \text{if }k=1, \\\\
1-p_0^* &amp;amp; \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$f(k;p_0^*) = \begin{cases} p_0^* &amp;amp; \text{if }k=1, \\&lt;br&gt;
1-p_0^* &amp;amp; \text {if }k=0.\end{cases}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diagrams&#34;&gt;Diagrams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;diagram&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.toml&lt;/code&gt; file or by adding &lt;code&gt;diagram: true&lt;/code&gt; to your page front matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example &lt;strong&gt;flowchart&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```mermaid
graph TD
A[Hard] --&amp;gt;|Text| B(Round)
B --&amp;gt; C{Decision}
C --&amp;gt;|One| D[Result 1]
C --&amp;gt;|Two| E[Result 2]
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;graph TD
A[Hard] --&amp;gt;|Text| B(Round)
B --&amp;gt; C{Decision}
C --&amp;gt;|One| D[Result 1]
C --&amp;gt;|Two| E[Result 2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example &lt;strong&gt;sequence diagram&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Hello John, how are you?
loop Healthcheck
    John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
John--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Alice: Great!
John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Bob: How about you?
Bob--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Jolly good!
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mermaid&#34;&gt;sequenceDiagram
Alice-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Hello John, how are you?
loop Healthcheck
    John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Fight against hypochondria
end
Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
John--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Alice: Great!
John-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Bob: How about you?
Bob--&amp;gt;&amp;gt;John: Jolly good!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example &lt;strong&gt;Gantt diagram&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;todo-lists&#34;&gt;Todo lists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even write your todo lists in Academic too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;- [x] Write math example
- [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;input checked=&#34;&#34; disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Write diagram example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Do something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tables&#34;&gt;Tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Represent your data in tables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;First Header&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Second Header&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Content Cell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;asides&#34;&gt;Asides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic supports a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#alerts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;shortcode for asides&lt;/a&gt;, also referred to as &lt;em&gt;notices&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hints&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;alerts&lt;/em&gt;. By wrapping a paragraph in &lt;code&gt;{{% alert note %}} ... {{% /alert %}}&lt;/code&gt;, it will render as an aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;{{% alert note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /alert %}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;icons&#34;&gt;Icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic enables you to use a wide range of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/page-builder/#icons&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;icons from &lt;em&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Academicons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in addition to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/#emojis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;emojis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples using the &lt;code&gt;icon&lt;/code&gt; shortcode to render icons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;{{&amp;lt; icon name=&amp;quot;terminal&amp;quot; pack=&amp;quot;fas&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} Terminal  
{{&amp;lt; icon name=&amp;quot;python&amp;quot; pack=&amp;quot;fab&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} Python  
{{&amp;lt; icon name=&amp;quot;r-project&amp;quot; pack=&amp;quot;fab&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}} R
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i class=&#34;fas fa-terminal  pr-1 fa-fw&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Terminal&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;i class=&#34;fab fa-python  pr-1 fa-fw&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Python&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;i class=&#34;fab fa-r-project  pr-1 fa-fw&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; R&lt;/p&gt;
